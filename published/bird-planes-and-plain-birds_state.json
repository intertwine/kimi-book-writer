      "content": "## Chapter 1: **Elsewhere, USA: A Novel**\n\n*\"Every map has an elsewhere. The trick is finding the dotted line.\"*\n\nZadie Patel\u2019s apartment was so small she could make coffee, answer emails, and water her dying ficus without taking her socks off. This was less a boast about multitasking and more a literal description of the seven-foot radius she inhabited every morning, a radius that currently smelled of burnt toast and yesterday\u2019s regrets.\n\n\u201cNo, Brian, I *cannot* push the meeting to three,\u201d she said into her phone, pinning it between her shoulder and ear while performing the aforementioned coffee-email-ficus trifecta. \u201cBecause three is when I have my other meeting. Yes, the one about the book about the dog who solves crypto crimes. No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2018derivative.\u2019 I think it\u2019s *pioneering*.\u201d\n\nShe hung up before her boss could argue further. The ficus dropped a leaf in protest. Zadie stared at it, wondering if this was what her life had become: negotiating with a middle-aged man about canine blockchain fiction in a studio where her bed was also her couch was also her dining table.\n\nOutside, Manhattan roared its usual symphony\u2014sirens, delivery bikes, a man yelling about the price of everything bagels. Zadie had lived in this same fifth-floor walk-up in Astoria for six years, ever since graduating from NYU with a degree in Comparative Literature and a delusional belief that she would somehow afford a one-bedroom by twenty-five. Now twenty-eight, she could afford exactly one thing: the rent, and only if she ate primarily lentils and stopped buying the *good* toilet paper.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Not Brian\u2014worse. Her mother.\n\n*Beta, have you considered the dental school application? Dr. Mehta\u2019s son is single and makes very good salary.*\n\nZadie typed back: *Still happy in publishing, Ma. Please stop fixing my teeth and my love life simultaneously.*\n\nShe tossed the phone onto her \u201cdesk\u201d\u2014a plank of wood balanced across two filing cabinets\u2014and opened her laptop. The screen glowed with the familiar hellscape of her inbox: manuscript rejections, meeting invites, a newsletter from a bookstore she\u2019d never visited. And there, sandwiched between an offer for discounted Viagra and a LinkedIn request from someone she\u2019d ghosted in 2019, was an ad.\n\n**TIRED OF YOUR ZIP CODE?** it read, in a font that suggested both whimsy and mild hallucination. **EXCHANGE LIVES WITH SOMEONE ELSEWHERE. USA ONLY. NO TAKEBACKS.**\n\nZadie almost deleted it. She\u2019d seen stranger scams\u2014there was that time someone offered to pay her in \u201cexposure\u201d to ghostwrite a memoir for a ferret. But something about the specificity of \u201cno takebacks\u201d made her pause. She clicked.\n\nThe website was minimalist to the point of suspicion. A single page, cream-colored, with a form that asked only three questions:\n\n1. *What do you want to leave?*\n2. *What are you willing to find?*\n3. *How long is forever?*\n\n\u201cOkay, this is definitely a cult,\u201d Zadie muttered. But her cursor hovered over the first field. What *did* she want to leave? The email pinged again\u2014Brian, asking if she could \u201cjust quickly\u201d read a 400-page manuscript about a sentient cruise ship. The ficus dropped another leaf. Downstairs, someone began practicing the trumpet.\n\nShe typed: *The noise. The hustle that feels less like ambition and more like panic in a blazer. The way my apartment is shrinking one square inch per day.*\n\nFor the second question, she hesitated. What was she willing to find? Silence? Space? A life where her worth wasn\u2019t measured in how many manuscripts she could devour before lunch?\n\nShe wrote: *Room to breathe. A sky that isn\u2019t sliced into rectangles by buildings. A version of myself that doesn\u2019t flinch when her phone buzzes.*\n\nThe third question was nonsense. Forever? She typed: *Six months. Maybe. Probably. I don\u2019t know.*\n\nShe hit submit before she could think better of it. The page refreshed to a single line: **APPLICATION RECEIVED. MATCHING YOUR DISSATISFACTION.**\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Zadie said to the ficus. \u201cI\u2019ve been matched with a serial killer in Nebraska.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThree hundred and twenty-seven miles west, Emmett Larsen was watching a thunderstorm roll across his father\u2019s cornfield like it owed him money. The clouds were the color of a bruise, heavy and mean, and he could already hear the wind picking up, whistling through the gaps in the old farmhouse windows.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gonna be a gullywasher,\u201d his dad called from the porch, using the kind of meteorological terminology that had been passed down through five generations of Larsens. \u201cBetter get the shutters.\u201d\n\nEmmett nodded, but he didn\u2019t move. He was standing in the middle of the driveway, barefoot, feeling the first fat drops of rain hit his shoulders. At twenty-seven, he\u2019d spent his entire life in this same house, on this same land, in this same town of 1,042 people who all knew his business before he did. He\u2019d gone to Iowa State for agronomy, come home to help his dad after the heart attack, and somehow never left. The temporary had become permanent, the way it always did in small towns.\n\nHis phone buzzed. A text from his ex-girlfriend, now married to his former high school teammate: *Saw ur truck at the co-op. Hope ur doing ok!*\n\nThe subtext: *I am thriving and you are still buying feed in the same flannel you wore in 2016.*\n\nEmmett didn\u2019t answer. The rain was coming harder now, and he could smell it\u2014that clean, electric scent of ozone and dirt that meant the world was about to refresh itself. He loved that smell. He also hated that he loved it, because loving it meant he was exactly where he was supposed to be, and where he was supposed to be felt like a shirt that had shrunk in the wash.\n\nInside, the house was quiet. His dad was napping in the recliner, the TV murmuring about soybean futures. Emmett\u2019s laptop sat open on the kitchen table, where he\u2019d been updating the farm\u2019s spreadsheets\u2014an endless parade of numbers that told him they were barely breaking even, that the land was tired, that he was tired.\n\nHe sat down, meaning to close it, but his email was still up. And there, between a message from the Farm Bureau and a coupon for Tractor Supply, was an ad.\n\n**TIRED OF YOUR ZIP CODE?** it asked, in a font that looked like it had been handwritten by someone who still wrote letters. **EXCHANGE LIVES WITH SOMEONE ELSEWHERE. USA ONLY. NO TAKEBACKS.**\n\nEmmett laughed. It was the first real laugh he\u2019d had in days. Exchange lives? Sure. He\u2019d trade his 4 a.m. alarm and his dad\u2019s medical bills and the way everyone in town looked at him with a mixture of pity and expectation for\u2026 what? A penthouse? A subway card? A job where he didn\u2019t have to check the radar every ten minutes?\n\nHe clicked. The questions were simple:\n\n1. *What do you want to leave?*\n2. *What are you willing to find?*\n3. *How long is forever?*\n\nThe rain pounded the roof. His dad snored softly. Emmett thought about the text from his ex, about the spreadsheets, about the way the horizon here was so flat you could see tomorrow coming and it looked exactly like today.\n\nHe typed: *The silence that isn\u2019t peaceful, just empty. The way everyone knows my story before I get to tell it. The feeling that I\u2019m living a life that was handed to me, not one I chose.*\n\nFor the second question, he paused. What did he want to find? Noise? Chaos? A place where no one knew his name or his father\u2019s name or his grandfather\u2019s name?\n\nHe wrote: *The chance to be new. To be anonymous. To be somewhere that doesn\u2019t feel like a memory I\u2019m stuck in.*\n\nFor the third, he typed: *Six months. Maybe. Probably. I don\u2019t know.*\n\nHe hit submit. The screen went white, then displayed: **APPLICATION RECEIVED. MATCHING YOUR DISSATISFACTION.**\n\nThe lights flickered. The storm was directly overhead now, shaking the old house. Emmett\u2019s dad woke up with a snort. \u201cPower out?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Emmett said, but he was still staring at the screen. It felt like a dare. Or a mistake. Or maybe just the first interesting thing that had happened to him since the county fair\u2019s butter sculpture contest.\n\n---\n\nZadie\u2019s confirmation email arrived at 6:47 p.m., just as she was stepping over a puddle of what she hoped was melted ice cream on the N train. It was brief:\n\n**CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR DISSATISFACTION HAS BEEN MATCHED.**\n**DESTINATION: ELK HORN, IOWA (POP. 1,042)**\n**DEPARTURE: JUNE 1ST. PACK LIGHT. LEAVE YOUR EXPECTATIONS.**\n\nShe almost deleted it. Elk Horn, Iowa? She\u2019d never heard of it. But she googled it anyway, standing in the swaying subway car, and found a Wikipedia page that looked like it had been last updated during the Bush administration. There was a photo of a windmill. Another of a cornfield. A third of a sign that read: *VELKOMMEN TIL ELK HORN*\u2014apparently it was the largest Danish settlement in America.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m being traded to Viking corn country.\u201d\n\nHer phone rang. Brian. She let it go to voicemail.\n\n---\n\nEmmett\u2019s email arrived at 5:47 p.m. Central time, which was, he noted, the exact moment the storm broke and the sun came out, turning everything steamy and gold.\n\n**CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR DISSATISFACTION HAS BEEN MATCHED.**\n**DESTINATION: ASTORIA, QUEENS, NEW YORK (POP. 95,000 GIVE OR TAKE)**\n**DEPARTURE: JUNE 1ST. PACK LIGHT. LEAVE YOUR EXPECTATIONS.**\n\nHe stared at it for a long time. Then he googled Astoria and found pictures of crowded streets, a subway line he\u2019d never heard of, and an apartment listing for a studio that cost more per month than his truck.\n\nHis dad shuffled into the kitchen, smelling of rain and sleep. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face for? We lose the south field?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Emmett said slowly. \u201cI think I just signed up to be someone else for a while.\u201d\n\nHis dad squinted at the screen. \u201cThat one of those reality TV shows? You gonna be on the TV?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Emmett lied. \u201cProbably not. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe old man nodded, as if this made perfect sense. \u201cWell. Don\u2019t forget to empty the dehumidifier before you go.\u201d\n\nEmmett looked out the window at the field, at the rows of corn stretching away like green soldiers. Then he looked back at the email, at the words *leave your expectations*, and wondered what kind of fool volunteers to be disappointed by a different sky.\n\nHe hit reply and typed a single word: *Confirmed.*\n\nIn Astoria, Zadie did the same.\n\nThe dotted line had been found."

      "content": "## Chapter 2: **Act I: The Great Exchange**\n\n*The problem with swapping seats is you still bring your own eyes to the view.*\n\n---\n\nZadie\u2019s Uber driver was a woman named Darlene who drove a spotless minivan and spoke at length about the weather as if it were a mutual friend who\u2019d recently betrayed them. \u201cNever seen June this humid,\u201d she clucked, adjusting the air conditioning with the reverence of a bomb technician. \u201cCorn\u2019ll be knee-high by the Fourth, though. That\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nZadie watched the landscape flatten and unspool outside the window. The sky was bigger here, which felt like a personal attack. In New York, the sky was a rumor you heard about from pigeons. Here it was a monologue. Cornfields stretched to the horizon, broken only by the occasional silo or barn that looked like it had been painted by someone who\u2019d only read about colors in a book. The windmill from the Wikipedia page appeared on her left, looking improbably real, like a prop someone had forgotten to take down after a musical.\n\n\u201cFirst time in Elk Horn?\u201d Darlene asked.\n\n\u201cFirst time in Iowa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you picked a good spot. We\u2019re the Danish capital of America. Got a museum and everything.\u201d\n\nZadie\u2019s phone buzzed. Brian again. She watched the call ring through to voicemail, then texted: *Stop. I\u2019m working.* A lie, but a necessary one. The truth\u2014that she\u2019d traded her Astoria sublet for a stranger\u2019s life in corn country for reasons she still couldn\u2019t articulate\u2014sounded like something you\u2019d tell a therapist, not an ex-boyfriend who still had a key to her apartment.\n\nThe minivan turned onto Main Street, which was exactly as wide as Zadie\u2019s expectations were low. There was a post office, a hardware store with a sign that read *HARDWARE*, and a diner called The Danish Table that appeared to be the social and gravitational center of the town. A group of old men sat outside on a bench, conducting what looked like a very serious investigation into the properties of sunlight.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Darlene announced, pulling up to a white two-story house with a wraparound porch and a flag that was not, as Zadie first thought, the Danish flag, but something with more colors and what might have been a windmill on it. \u201cThe Andersen place. Mette\u2019s expecting you.\u201d\n\nZadie climbed out, her single suitcase feeling like a joke in this landscape of silos and sky. The front door opened before she could knock, revealing a woman in her sixties with silver braids and an apron that had seen things.\n\n\u201cYou must be Zadie,\u201d she said, wiping her hands. \u201cI\u2019m Mette Andersen. You\u2019re taller than you looked in your profile picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cFilters,\u201d Zadie muttered.\n\nMette\u2019s laugh was a surprising thing, like a firecracker in a library. \u201cWell, come in. I\u2019ve got coffee on, and there\u2019s a strudel that just came out of the oven. You look like you could use some feeding up.\u201d\n\nInside, the house smelled of cinnamon and old wood and something Zadie couldn\u2019t place until she saw the ceramic cow on the windowsill and realized it was the smell of *intentional* cows, not the accidental ones you got in certain Brooklyn neighborhoods. The living room was a shrine to Danish heritage: rosemaling on every wooden surface, a portrait of what Zadie assumed was a very important Viking, and at least seven different interpretations of the Danish flag.\n\n\u201cYour room\u2019s upstairs,\u201d Mette said, leading her to a staircase that creaked with the satisfaction of a job well done. \u201cYou\u2019ll have the whole second floor to yourself. I\u2019m a early riser, but I tiptoe. Mostly.\u201d\n\nThe room was small and clean, with a slanted ceiling and a window that looked out over the backyard, which contained a vegetable garden, a clothesline, and a shed that had a weather vane shaped like a rooster. The bed had a quilt that looked hand-stitched. Zadie touched it gingerly, as if it might be a trap.\n\n\u201cBathroom\u2019s across the hall,\u201d Mette continued. \u201cTowels are in the cupboard. I left a map of the town on the dresser, though you can see most of it from the window. Supper\u2019s at six. We\u2019re having frikadeller.\u201d\n\nZadie nodded as if she knew what that was. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d She searched for the word. \u201cVery cozy.\u201d\n\nMette smiled, revealing a gap between her front teeth that made her look like she was about to tell a secret. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do here. Cozy. You\u2019ll get used to it, or you\u2019ll go mad. Sometimes both.\u201d\n\nWhen Mette left, Zadie sat on the bed and listened to the silence. It was a different species than New York silence, which was always negotiating with the next siren or argument. This silence had tenure. It owned the place. She pulled out her phone\u2014one bar, which felt like a personal insult\u2014and saw Brian had left a voicemail. She deleted it without listening, then opened her email.\n\nThe program had sent her a list of her \u201cexchange obligations.\u201d She was to work at the local library three days a week, assist with the upcoming Tivoli Festival, and \u201cimmerse herself in the community.\u201d The last one was underlined, which felt aggressive.\n\nHer phone buzzed again. Not Brian this time, but a text from an unknown number: *Welcome to Elk Horn! This is your exchange partner, Emmett. Mette says you made it. Hope the trip was okay.*\n\nZadie stared at the message. This was the person whose life she\u2019d stepped into. She typed: *Trip was fine. Your room is weirdly quiet.*\n\nShe deleted it. Typed: *Thanks. Your apartment is\u2014*\n\nDeleted that too. Finally settled on: *Made it. Thanks for the quilt.*\n\nShe hit send before she could overthink it further.\n\n---\n\nEmmett\u2019s flight had been delayed in Chicago, which he took as a sign that even the universe needed time to process what he was doing. He spent three hours in O\u2019Hare watching a man in a business suit have a very quiet breakdown over a bagel, and wondering if this was what civilization had come to.\n\nThe cab from LaGuardia to Astoria cost more than his first truck. The driver, who introduced himself only as \u201cViktor, like the author,\u201d navigated the BQE with a religious fervor, muttering what Emmett assumed were prayers in a language that was definitely not English. The city rose up around them like a concrete tide, buildings stacked on buildings, signs screaming in languages Emmett had only seen on takeout menus. Everything moved faster than seemed advisable.\n\n\u201cFirst time in Queens?\u201d Viktor asked, swerving around a cyclist who was either very brave or very stupid.\n\n\u201cFirst time in New York.\u201d\n\nViktor whistled. \u201cYou are in for education. Astoria is good place. Greeks, Egyptians, young people with glasses. Very authentic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthentic what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthentic everything. Here, look.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a street where a man was selling what appeared to be entire lambs from a cart, while a woman in hijab argued with a vendor over the price of mangoes that glowed like sunset. A subway rattled overhead, shaking loose a fine dust of urban sediment. Emmett pressed his forehead to the window and tried to remember how to breathe.\n\nThe apartment was on 31st Street, above a Greek bakery that smelled of honey and yeast and something like destiny. The landlord, Mrs. Katsaros, was a tiny woman with the energy of a supernova who spoke in a mixture of English and Greek that somehow made perfect sense.\n\n\u201cYou are the Iowa boy,\u201d she announced, not waiting for confirmation. \u201cGood. You are tall. The last one was short and broke the ceiling fan. Don\u2019t break the ceiling fan. Come.\u201d\n\nThe apartment was a studio that had been described in the exchange profile as \u201ccozy\u201d and \u201cfull of character,\u201d which Emmett now understood were real estate terms for \u201cyou can touch both walls at once\u201d and \u201cthe character is mold.\u201d It was dominated by a Murphy bed that looked like it had a grudge, a kitchenette the size of a confession booth, and a window that faced a brick wall decorated with a mural of what might have been a pigeon or a very angry angel.\n\n\u201cThe bathroom is here,\u201d Mrs. Katsaros said, opening a door that revealed a shower stall so narrow it seemed designed for meditation rather than hygiene. \u201cThe hot water is moody. So am I. You need something, you call. Otherwise, you live your life, I live mine. The bakery opens at five. Don\u2019t sleep through it, you\u2019ll wake up thinking you\u2019re in Greece.\u201d\n\nShe left him with a set of keys that weighed as much as his conscience and a phone number written on the back of a baklava receipt.\n\nEmmett stood in the center of the apartment and did a slow turn. From the window, he could hear the subway, a siren, someone shouting in Spanish about a dog. It was the opposite of silence. It was silence\u2019s extroverted cousin who\u2019d had too much coffee.\n\nHis phone buzzed. A text from the unknown number that was now saved as *Zadie (NYC)*: *Made it. Thanks for the quilt.*\n\nHe looked around the apartment, which contained no quilts but did have a polyester blanket that had probably witnessed the Nixon administration. He typed: *Glad you made it. The apartment is\u2014* He searched for the word. *\u2014loud.*\n\nHe hit send. A moment later, another text: *The town is the opposite. We might have miscalculated.*\n\nEmmett smiled despite himself. He walked to the window and looked out at the mural. Up close, it was definitely a pigeon, wearing a crown. He took a picture and sent it to her. *This is watching me sleep.*\n\nHer reply was immediate: *That\u2019s Gerald. He\u2019s famous. Don\u2019t make eye contact.*\n\n---\n\nZadie spent her first afternoon walking the perimeter of Elk Horn, which took forty-five minutes and included two stops to admire gardens and one incident where a golden retriever followed her for three blocks before getting distracted by a butterfly. The town was aggressively quaint. The post office had a flagpole with a flag that was actually at half-mast, which Zadie found unsettlingly sincere. The hardware store had a help wanted sign that looked hand-painted by someone who cared about kerning. The Danish Museum was closed for renovations, which felt like a metaphor.\n\nShe ended up at The Danish Table, where a waitress named Ingrid who was probably seventeen but had the bearing of a retirement planner brought her coffee and a slice of kringle without asking if she wanted it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the girl from New York,\u201d Ingrid said, not as a question.\n\n\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. We just don\u2019t get many new stories here. The last new person was a man from Des Moines who opened a vape shop. It closed in a month.\u201d\n\nZadie sipped the coffee. It was surprisingly good. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe moved to Des Moines. Said we were too exciting.\u201d Ingrid smiled, revealing braces that had tiny rubber bands the color of the Danish flag. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine. You look like you know how to handle excitement.\u201d\n\nZadie wasn\u2019t sure if this was a compliment or a diagnosis.\n\n---\n\nEmmett\u2019s first night in Astoria was a masterclass in urban acoustics. The subway ran until what felt like infinity. Someone played reggaeton at a volume that suggested either a party or a personal vendetta. At 2 a.m., a man on the street below had a loud and detailed conversation with a parking meter.\n\nHe lay on the Murphy bed, which had descended with the sigh of a falling tree, and stared at the ceiling. There was a water stain shaped like Iowa. He took a picture and sent it to Zadie.\n\nHer reply came at what would have been 4 a.m. her time: *That\u2019s the ghost of every Iowa farmer who tried to live here. You\u2019re doomed.*\n\nHe laughed, the sound foreign in the small room. *What\u2019s your ghost?*\n\n*A pigeon named Gerald and a quilt that smells like cinnamon. I think I\u2019ve been adopted.*\n\nThey texted back and forth until dawn, two strangers mapping their disorientation onto each other\u2019s screens. When the bakery ovens fired up at five, Emmett was still awake. The smell of honey and yeast filled the apartment, and for the first time since he\u2019d landed, something felt like it might be okay.\n\nDown in Elk Horn, Zadie listened to Mette singing Danish folk songs while she made breakfast. The sun came up over the cornfields, turning everything gold and impossible. She pulled the quilt up to her chin and wondered what kind of fool volunteers to be disappointed by a different sky.\n\nThe answer, she was beginning to suspect, was the exact same kind of fool who might not be disappointed after all."

      "content": "## Chapter 3: **The Night We Both Ran Away**\n\n*\u201cThe corn grows whether you watch it or not. The city breathes whether you sleep or not. You might as well go for a walk.\u201d \u2014 Mette Jorgensen, while ladling soup*\n\n---\n\n**Zadie ran out of patience at 8:47 p.m.** Central Time, which was precisely when Mette\u2019s cousin Lars began playing the accordion.\n\nThe living room of Mette\u2019s farmhouse had transformed into a miniature Danish folk festival. There were seven people, three of whom were named Jorgen, and all of whom seemed to know the words to a song about a sailor who fell in love with a mermaid but married a lighthouse instead. Zadie sat on the cinnamon-scented quilt\u2014now functioning as a sofa cover\u2014watching a woman knit what appeared to be a sweater for a sheepdog while simultaneously singing in perfect harmony.\n\nHer phone buzzed. *How\u2019s Viking corn country?*\n\nEmmett. She typed back: *Currently being serenaded by an accordion and a collective trauma about maritime dating.*\n\n*Better than the guy downstairs,* he replied. *He\u2019s either assembling furniture or performing an exorcism.*\n\nZadie smiled, but it felt tight. The room was too warm. The candlelight too sincere. She was expected to stay until at least ten, when \u201cthe hygge peaks,\u201d according to Mette, who had pressed a mug of gl\u00f8gg into her hands and told her to drink it slowly because \u201cthe almonds sink to the bottom and tell secrets.\u201d\n\nZadie had never been good at communal joy. In New York, loneliness was a performance art\u2014you could be lonely in a crowd of five hundred and it felt appropriate, earned. Here, loneliness in a crowd of seven felt like a moral failing.\n\nShe slipped out the back door while Lars reached the mermaid-lighthouse climax, which involved a lot of high notes and hand gestures.\n\n---\n\n**Emmett ran out of his apartment at 9:12 p.m.** Eastern Time, which was exactly seventeen minutes after the man downstairs had begun what was either a very loud breakup or a very quiet murder.\n\nThe Murphy bed had swallowed his phone. He\u2019d been trying to fish it out from between the wall and the mattress when the shouting started. Something about betrayal, something about a cat that wasn\u2019t his, something about the rent being too damn high\u2014which, Emmett had to agree with, having just transferred his entire savings to a landlord who communicated exclusively through Venmo requests and cryptic emojis.\n\nHe gave up on the phone, grabbed his wallet, and fled. The hallway smelled like someone was cooking something that involved fish and regret. The stairwell was a vertical echo chamber of other people\u2019s lives: a baby crying, a sitcom laugh track, a woman speaking Russian into a Bluetooth headset with the intensity of a general commanding troops.\n\nOutside, Astoria hit him like a wall of humid, living noise. The subway rattled overhead on its elevated tracks, spitting sparks that looked like dying stars. A guy on a bicycle was selling mangoes from a cooler strapped to his handlebars, shouting prices in three languages. The air smelled like diesel and jasmine and the particular funk of a city that never quite cooled down.\n\nEmmett walked. He had no destination, which was a new sensation. In Iowa, you always had a destination\u2014the field, the co-op, the diner where they knew your order. Here, destination seemed optional. Survival seemed optional. Everything was optional except motion.\n\nHis phone was back in the apartment, probably buzzing with texts from Zadie. He wondered if she was asleep. It was earlier there. Maybe she was at a bar. Maybe she was at a windmill. He realized he had no idea what people did for fun in Elk Horn after dark. Probably not wander the streets talking to parking meters. That felt like a him-specific problem.\n\n---\n\n**Zadie\u2019s feet took her to the windmill.** It was the one from the Wikipedia page, the one that apparently made Elk Horn the largest Danish settlement in America. At night, it looked less like a tourist attraction and more like a monument to some forgotten agricultural god. The sails were still, silhouetted against a sky so thick with stars it looked fake, like a planetarium ceiling.\n\nHer phone buzzed. *Where\u2019d you escape to?*\n\nShe hadn\u2019t told him she\u2019d escaped. But of course he\u2019d know. She typed: *The windmill. It\u2019s judging me.*\n\n*What\u2019s it saying?*\n\n*That I don\u2019t know how to be still.*\n\nShe could almost hear him think about that. The reply took a minute: *The city\u2019s not big on stillness either. I think I just walked three miles in a circle. Passed the same mango guy twice.*\n\n*Are you happy?* she typed, then deleted it. Too direct. Too much. She sent instead: *What does your circle smell like?*\n\n*Mango. Exhaust. Someone\u2019s really good cologne. Yours?*\n\n*Dust. Crickets. The ghost of a thousand Danish folk songs.*\n\nA car rolled by, the first she\u2019d seen in twenty minutes. It was Ingrid\u2019s dad, she thought, the one who ran the feed store. He waved. She waved back. The car disappeared, and the silence rushed back in like water filling a footprint.\n\nZadie sat at the base of the windmill. The grass was damp with dew. In New York, grass was a theoretical concept, something that existed in parks you didn\u2019t have time to visit. Here, it was a living carpet that would soak your jeans if you let it. She let it.\n\nHer phone buzzed again, but it wasn\u2019t Emmett. It was Brian. *Miss you, babe. This place is a mess without you.* She deleted it without reading the rest. The subtext was always the same: *Come back and fix things. Come back and be the person I need.*\n\nShe\u2019d spent five years being the person everyone needed. The reliable one. The one who remembered birthdays and paid the ConEd bill on time and knew which bodega sold the good coffee at 2 a.m. She\u2019d signed up for this swap because she was tired of being needed. But now, in a town where nobody needed her, she felt weightless in a way that was closer to panic than freedom.\n\nShe texted Emmett: *I think I broke up with my life.*\n\nHis reply was immediate: *Mine\u2019s in the shop. Getting an oil change.*\n\nShe laughed, a real laugh that echoed off the windmill. A dog barked somewhere, and another answered. The crickets had a rhythm section now. It was a terrible song, but it was *hers*, at least for the moment.\n\n---\n\n**Emmett\u2019s circle had taken him to the East River.** He hadn\u2019t meant to go that far, but the city had a way of nudging you toward water. He stood at the edge of Astoria Park, watching the Manhattan skyline glitter across the river like a promise made by someone who couldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nHe thought about his dad, who\u2019d probably be asleep on the couch by now, the TV still on, the dehumidifier humming its lonely song. He thought about the south field, which needed rotating. He thought about the email that had brought him here: *Leave your expectations.*\n\nWhat he hadn\u2019t expected was how loud loneliness could be in a city of millions. In Iowa, loneliness was quiet. It was the space between rows of corn, the hum of a single engine on a county road. Here, loneliness was a cacophony. It was being pressed against a hundred people on the subway and not making eye contact with a single one. It was the mango guy calling you \u201cboss\u201d but not knowing your name.\n\nHis phone was back in the apartment. He should go get it. Instead, he sat on a bench and watched a tugboat push a barge upriver. The water smelled like rust and salt and the kind of history they didn\u2019t teach in Iowa schools.\n\nA woman sat down next to him. She had a tote bag full of groceries and was talking on her phone in Greek. She didn\u2019t acknowledge him, which felt both rude and correct. After a minute, she offered him a fig from a paper bag. He took it without question. It was perfect, sweet in a way that made his teeth ache.\n\n\u201cFirst time in Astoria?\u201d she asked, still into her phone.\n\n\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have that look. Like you\u2019re waiting for someone to tell you the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are rules?\u201d\n\nShe finally looked at him, smiled. \u201cOnly one. Don\u2019t block the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nShe stood, walked away, became part of the city\u2019s bloodstream again. Emmett ate the fig and thought about rules. In Iowa, the rules were written in the soil: plant after the last frost, rotate your crops, help your neighbor when the sky turns green. Here, the rules were whispered, negotiated, constantly revised.\n\nHe stood up. He needed his phone. He needed to know if Zadie was still at the windmill, if she was still laughing, if she still felt like she\u2019d broken up with her life. He needed to tell her about the fig, about the woman, about how the city was teaching him things he hadn\u2019t asked to learn.\n\n---\n\n**Zadie walked back through the cornfields.** Not the rows\u2014she wasn\u2019t a monster\u2014but along the dirt road that bisected them. The corn was taller than she\u2019d realized, a living wall that rustled with secrets. She half-expected a child with a knife to step out and offer her a religious pamphlet, but the only thing that emerged was a deer, which looked at her with profound disappointment before bounding away.\n\nHer phone buzzed. *Coming back?* Emmett.\n\n*Already am. You?*\n\n*Got locked out. Mango guy remembered me. Gave me a free one. I think I\u2019m a local now.*\n\nShe pictured him, this Iowa boy with his trucker hat and his careful manners, accepting a mango from a guy on a bicycle at midnight. The image was so perfect it hurt.\n\n*Meet me at the windmill tomorrow?* she typed. *I\u2019ll bring the ghosts.*\n\n*Deal. I\u2019ll bring the mango.*\n\nShe slipped back into Mette\u2019s house through the kitchen door. The accordion had been retired. The candlelight had burned down to stubs. Someone had left a plate of butter cookies on the table, shaped like windmills. She took one and ate it standing over the sink, letting the crumbs fall into the basin. It tasted like belonging and exile at the same time.\n\nUpstairs, Gerald the pigeon was asleep on the windowsill, a gray lump of feathers and indifference. She changed into the oversized t-shirt she\u2019d stolen from Brian two years ago\u2014the one that said *NEW YORK FUCKING CITY* in aggressive block letters\u2014and crawled under the quilt.\n\nHer phone buzzed one last time. *The water stain is gone,* Emmett wrote. *I think it was waiting for you to leave.*\n\nShe didn\u2019t know what that meant, but she liked it. She typed back: *The crickets are still here. They\u2019re not impressed.*\n\n*Goodnight, Zadie.*\n\n*Goodnight, Emmett.*\n\nShe lay in the dark, listening to the house settle, to the corn grow, to the ghosts of Danish folk songs hum themselves to sleep. She thought about running away, and how it felt less like escape and more like arrival.\n\nIn Astoria, Emmett climbed the stairs to his apartment, mango in hand. The door was still locked. He sat on the top step and ate it, juice running down his wrist, watching the sky lighten from black to bruise-blue. The city was waking up. The bakery ovens were firing. The mango guy was pedaling home.\n\nHe thought about running away, and how it felt less like leaving and more like leaning in.\n\nThe night they both ran away, they found themselves exactly where they were supposed to be: lost, and not minding it at all."

      "content": "## Chapter 4: **The App That Appeared at Midnight**\n\n*\u201cThe best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of\u2014wait, no, that\u2019s Gandhi. The best way to find yourself is to accidentally download a mysterious app at midnight and hope it\u2019s not malware.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Zadie** was awake when the clock struck twelve because the crickets had formed a union and were negotiating overtime pay directly outside her window. Or at least that\u2019s what it felt like. The noise was orchestral, maddening, and weirdly specific\u2014like each insect had been assigned a separate note and was determined to play it until someone filed a noise complaint.\n\nShe\u2019d been in Elk Horn for six days. Six days of butter cookies, Danish folk songs, and a quilt that smelled so strongly of cinnamon she was starting to suspect it was actually made of cinnamon. Gerald the pigeon had accepted her presence with the grace of a deposed monarch, shitting on the windowsill exactly once per day as a reminder of who really owned the air rights.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Not a text\u2014Emmett was asleep, or should be. It was a notification from an app she didn\u2019t remember installing.\n\n**ELSEWHERE** had appeared on her home screen, icon a simple white circle with a tiny black dot off-center, like a pupil in an eye that wasn\u2019t quite looking at you.\n\nShe tapped it.\n\nThe screen went black. Then, in lowercase letters: *welcome back, zadie.*\n\nBack? She\u2019d never been here before.\n\nA map loaded\u2014satellite view of Elk Horn, so detailed she could see the individual rows of corn in Mette\u2019s field. A single pin pulsed at the windmill. Below it, text: **Your Anchor Point. Do Not Lose.**\n\nShe snorted. As if she could lose a windmill. It was the tallest thing for twenty miles.\n\nThen the app asked: *what did you discover today?*\n\nShe typed: *Butter cookies are a legitimate food group.*\n\nThe app responded: **Accepted. +10 Local Knowledge. Continue.**\n\nA new screen appeared: **Emmett\u2019s Astoria (Live).** It was a blurred photo of a bodega window, neon sign buzzing, a cat sleeping on a stack of plantains. The caption read: *He is learning to see in the dark.*\n\nZadie\u2019s stomach did something complicated. She zoomed in on the cat. It looked like it had seen things.\n\n---\n\n**Emmett** was awake because the man in 4B had decided 11:47 p.m. was the perfect time to practice what sounded like either tap-dancing or amateur carpentry. The ceiling thumped in a rhythm that suggested ambition without skill. He\u2019d given up on sleep and was sitting on the fire escape, eating the second mango the mango guy had given him\u2014*\u201cOn the house, Iowa. You\u2019re a regular now.\u201d*\u2014when his phone lit up.\n\n**ELSEWHERE** sat between his weather app and the one that tracked corn futures. He definitely hadn\u2019t downloaded it.\n\nHe opened it.\n\n*welcome back, emmett.*\n\nThe map that loaded showed Astoria in hyper-detail, down to the graffiti tag on the bakery door. A pin pulsed at his apartment building. **Your Anchor Point. Do Not Lose.**\n\nThen: *what did you discover today?*\n\nHe thought about the mango guy, about the way the city changed after midnight\u2014how the bodegas became small kingdoms, how the streets filled with people who had nowhere to be but couldn\u2019t stand to be still. He typed: *Free mangoes taste better.*\n\n**Accepted. +10 Local Knowledge. Continue.**\n\nA new screen: **Zadie\u2019s Elk Horn (Live).** A photo of a cornfield at dusk, the rows so straight they looked like lines of poetry. A shadow moved through them\u2014someone walking. The caption: *She is learning to be still.*\n\nEmmett zoomed in. It was Zadie, tiny and grainy, wearing what looked like a stolen t-shirt, her hair a dark smudge against the gold. He felt something tighten in his chest\u2014not longing, exactly, but the ghost of it. The possibility.\n\n---\n\nThe app gave them both the same instruction at 12:03 a.m.:\n\n**Task: Leave your anchor point. Find something that doesn\u2019t belong. Bring it back. Do not explain. Points awarded for mystery.**\n\nZadie stared at the screen. *Points?* She was a grown woman. She didn\u2019t need points. But the app had a way of making disobedience feel like missing out, like skipping the best part of a story.\n\nShe pulled on Brian\u2019s t-shirt\u2014*NEW YORK FUCKING CITY* screaming across her chest\u2014and slipped downstairs. Mette\u2019s house was asleep, the accordion silent, the butter cookies covered with a dish towel. The front door creaked like it was telling secrets.\n\nOutside, the air was a different substance than NYC air. It had weight, intention. The cornfields rustled with their own language. She walked toward the windmill, because where else would you go in Elk Horn at midnight? It loomed against the stars, a dark skeleton against all that light.\n\nShe found the thing that didn\u2019t belong wedged in the windmill\u2019s door: a single, pristine subway card. MetroCard, the real deal, not the new OMNY system. It had $2.75 on it, according to the faded stamp on the back. Someone had drawn a tiny windmill on it in ballpoint pen.\n\nShe took it. The app pinged: **+25 Mystery Points. Excellent work.**\n\n---\n\nEmmett\u2019s task was harder. Astoria at midnight was a place that belonged to everyone and no one. Everything belonged. The broken umbrella in the gutter, the lone rollerblade hanging from a telephone wire, the mattress propped against a tree like a drunk friend\u2014each had a story, a right to be there.\n\nHe walked past the bakery, where the ovens were finally cooling, past the bodega where the cat still slept on the plantains. He found himself at the waterfront, looking across the East River at Manhattan\u2019s glow. The city was a jewelry box someone had forgotten to close.\n\nThat\u2019s where he saw it: a single stalk of corn, growing from a crack in the concrete. It was only about two feet tall, its leaves frayed from exhaust and indifference, but it was undeniably corn. Someone had tied a tiny Danish flag to it, a scrap of red and white fabric no bigger than a postage stamp.\n\nHe took a picture. The app pinged: **+25 Mystery Points. You understand.**\n\nHe didn\u2019t. But he pulled the flag free and put it in his pocket.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:17 a.m., the app opened a chat window between them. No typing indicators. Just messages appearing as if the phone already knew what you wanted to say.\n\n**Zadie:** I found your MetroCard.\n\n**Emmett:** I found your corn.\n\n**Zadie:** Did it have a flag?\n\n**Emmett:** Did yours have a windmill?\n\n**Zadie:** Yes.\n\n**Emmett:** Then we\u2019re even.\n\n**Zadie:** We\u2019re not even. We\u2019re just both lost.\n\n**Emmett:** The app says that\u2019s the point.\n\n**Zadie:** The app is a know-it-all.\n\n**Emmett:** The app is probably right.\n\nThey stopped typing. The app filled the silence with a new feature: **Shared Inventory.** The MetroCard and the Danish flag appeared as icons, rotating slowly. Below them, text: *These items are now linked. Use them wisely.*\n\nZadie held the MetroCard up to the moonlight. It felt like a promise, or a threat. She slipped it into the pocket of her stolen t-shirt.\n\nEmmett tied the Danish flag to his keychain. It fluttered like a tiny surrender.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, the app had a new message for each of them.\n\n**Zadie:** *Your task: Teach someone something they didn\u2019t know about where you came from. Bonus points if they don\u2019t realize you\u2019re teaching them.*\n\nShe found Ingrid at the front desk of the Danish Museum, which was really just two rooms and a gift shop that sold wooden shoes and nostalgia. Ingrid was polishing a display case that held a single butter churn.\n\n\u201cI have a question,\u201d Zadie said, leaning on the counter. \u201cWhat do you think New York smells like?\u201d\n\nIngrid blinked. \u201cConcrete? Desperation?\u201d\n\n\u201cCinnamon,\u201d Zadie said. \u201cAnd hot mangoes at midnight.\u201d\n\nIngrid frowned. \u201cMangoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Queens thing. There\u2019s this guy on a bike. He gives them to people who look lost.\u201d\n\nIngrid looked at her like she\u2019d started speaking in tongues. But later, when Zadie walked past the museum, she saw Ingrid googling \u201cmango Queens midnight\u201d on the ancient desktop computer. The app pinged: **+15 Subtlety Points.**\n\n---\n\n**Emmett:** *Your task: Learn something you didn\u2019t know about where you are. Bonus points if you\u2019re not trying.*\n\nHe wasn\u2019t trying. He was just buying coffee from the bakery when the woman behind the counter\u2014her name tag said *Stavroula*\u2014asked, \u201cYou the Iowa boy?\u201d\n\nNews traveled fast in neighborhoods where everyone stood in the same line every day.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nShe slid him a coffee and a pastry he hadn\u2019t ordered. \u201cYou know why we have so many Greeks here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause Queens is the place you go when you\u2019ve outgrown the place you came from. It\u2019s not the destination. It\u2019s the in-between. You understand?\u201d\n\nHe thought about the corn stalk, about the mango guy, about the water stain that had disappeared. \u201cI think I\u2019m starting to.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, satisfied. \u201cGood. The in-between is where the good stuff happens.\u201d\n\nThe app pinged: **+20 Wisdom Points. Stavroula approves.**\n\n---\n\nThat night, at exactly midnight, the app opened a video call.\n\nZadie was in her room, the quilt pulled up to her chin. Emmett was on the fire escape, the city humming behind him. They both answered before the first ring finished.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said.\n\nThey stared at each other, pixelated and real. The app had no filters, no effects. Just their faces, tired and awake in a way that felt like honesty.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re supposed to meet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe windmill,\u201d he agreed.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d\n\nThe app typed for them: **You are both exactly where you need to be. The meeting is optional. The finding is not.**\n\nZadie held up the MetroCard. \u201cI\u2019m keeping this.\u201d\n\nEmmett held up the Danish flag. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we hoarders?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we crazy?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe app closed the call. But not before Zadie saw the mango guy\u2019s bicycle propped against Emmett\u2019s building, and not before Emmett saw Gerald the pigeon land on Zadie\u2019s windowsill, a gray ghost checking in on its tenant.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent them both a final message for the night:\n\n**You have accumulated enough points to unlock: The Reason.**\n\nZadie\u2019s screen showed a single line: *You ran away to find the thing you couldn\u2019t name.*\n\nEmmett\u2019s screen showed: *You stayed to name the thing you couldn\u2019t find.*\n\nThey both tried to reply, but the app had already disappeared, leaving only the icons in their shared inventory spinning slowly, endlessly, like a windmill in a wind they couldn\u2019t feel.\n\nZadie lay back on the pillow that smelled like cinnamon and cornfields. Emmett stayed on the fire escape, the city breathing around him. They were both lost, and they were both found, and they were both exactly where they were supposed to be: somewhere else.\n\nThe app had appeared at midnight. The app would appear again. But for now, they had the MetroCard and the Danish flag, the mango and the pigeon, the thing that didn\u2019t belong and the place that did.\n\nThey had each other\u2019s ghosts.\n\nAnd that, for now, was enough."

The third was to provide two forms of ID and a handwritten essay on why he deserved a library card.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re from *Iowa*,\u201d the librarian said, examining his driver\u2019s license as if it were a specimen from a distant planet. \u201cDo they have libraries there?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust the one,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cWe share. It\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d\n\nThe librarian, a woman with silver hair and a name tag that read **DORIS \u2013 RETIRED BUT STILL JUDGING**, slid the card across the counter. \u201cWelcome to Queens. We have six branches in a three-block radius. Don\u2019t get cocky.\u201d\n\nBack in Elk Horn, Zadie was signing her own triplicate forms. They were mimeographed, smelled of purple ink and nostalgia, and requested her signature for: (1) a temporary position as a docent at the Danish Windmill, (2) a liability waiver in case she was impaled by a rogue wooden shoe during the wooden shoe demonstration, and (3) a promise that she would not, under any circumstances, refer to the museum\u2019s prized 19th-century butter churn as \u201cquaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine,\u201d said the museum director, a man named Soren who looked like he\u2019d been carved from the same oak as the windmill blades. \u201cJust remember: the Danes who built this place didn\u2019t cross an ocean to be called *quaint*.\u201d\n\nZadie signed with a ballpoint pen that had a tiny Danish flag on the cap. The flag matched the one in her pocket, the one the app had given her. She wondered if signing in triplicate was a universal constant, like gravity or the way both cities smelled different after rain.\n\nThe app had been quiet for three days. Long enough for Zadie to learn the difference between *hygge* and *uhygge* (coziness and its sinister twin, un-coziness). Long enough for Emmett to discover that the water stain on his ceiling had returned, but now it looked like Denmark.\n\nThey texted, but less frantically. The initial vertigo of displacement had settled into a manageable dizziness. Emmett sent photos of his new library card. Zadie sent photos of the wooden shoes she\u2019d been forbidden to mock. They were both building scaffolding.\n\n---\n\n**Inventory Update at 2:47 p.m.:**\n\n**Emmett holds:**\n- 1 MetroCard (unlimited, slightly bent)\n- 1 Danish flag (fabric, pocket-sized)\n- 1 library card (Queens Public Library, Astoria branch)\n- 1 growing suspicion that the mango guy is following him\n\n**Zadie holds:**\n- 1 Danish flag (fabric, pocket-sized)\n- 1 MetroCard (unlimited, pristine)\n- 1 wooden shoe keychain (gift from Soren, possibly cursed)\n- 1 pigeon named Gerald who has begun sleeping on her pillow\n\n---\n\nThe app reappeared on a Tuesday, which was fitting, because Tuesday was the day the Iowans apparently shared their library. It manifested not with a notification but with a sound: the soft *thwip* of a paper fan opening. Both phones displayed the same message:\n\n**Please sign the following in triplicate.  \nCopy 1: For the place you left.  \nCopy 2: For the place you are.  \nCopy 3: For the place you\u2019re becoming.**\n\nEmmett was on the fire escape, eating a mango that had, true to his inventory suspicion, been handed to him by the mango guy, who had indeed been waiting outside his building. The man had a new bicycle. It had a basket. In the basket was a single mango and a copy of *The New Yorker* from 1987.\n\n\u201cFor the archives,\u201d the mango guy had said, then pedaled away humming what sounded like a Danish folk song.\n\nZadie was in the windmill\u2019s upper loft, dusting the blades with a feather duster that was, according to Soren, \u201chistorically accurate and also completely useless.\u201d Gerald rode on her shoulder, a warm weight of feathers and judgment.\n\nThe app presented them with a document. Not a digital form, but something that looked like it had been typed on a manual typewriter, then scanned by a machine that hated clarity.\n\n**THE INTERIM RESIDENCE AGREEMENT**\n\n*This agreement, made between Party A (The Runaway) and Party B (The Stayed), acknowledges that both parties are currently occupying spaces that do not belong to them in any legal sense, but belong to them entirely in every other sense.*\n\n*Clause 1: You will not apologize for the ghosts you bring with you. They have baggage fees prepaid.*\n\n*Clause 2: The mango is not a metaphor. The pigeon is not a symbol. They are simply a man on a bicycle and a bird on a windowsill, and that is enough.*\n\n*Clause 3: You are allowed to love a place that doesn\u2019t love you back yet. Cities and towns are slow to trust. Keep showing up.*\n\n*Clause 4: The water stain and the wooden shoe have equal spiritual weight. Do not rank your hauntings.*\n\n*Clause 5: Sign here. Then sign again. Then sign once more, just to be sure.*\n\nAt the bottom were three lines. Above each, a prompt:\n\n**For the you that was:** ___________________\n\n**For the you that is:** ___________________\n\n**For the you that will be:** ___________________\n\nEmmett stared at the screen. The city pulsed behind him, a living thing with sirens for a heartbeat. He thought about his father\u2019s farm, the way the soil had a specific smell in April, like waking up. He thought about the Murphy bed, the water stain, the mango guy\u2019s new bicycle basket. He thought about Zadie\u2019s texts, the way she described the corn at night as \u201ca dark ocean that whispers in Morse code.\u201d\n\nHe typed:\n\n**For the you that was:** *Emmett, who knew the bus schedule by heart*\n\n**For the you that is:** *Emmett, who is learning the subway map is a living document*\n\n**For the you that will be:** *Emmett, who might be both*\n\nHe pressed his thumb to the screen. The phone hummed, and the signature lines dissolved, replaced by a single spinning windmill icon.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie held her phone with hands dusty from historical artifacts. Gerald pecked at the screen, helpfully adding a stray feather to the contract. She thought about her apartment in Astoria, the way the light hit the fire escape at 5 p.m., making it look like a ladder to somewhere. She thought about Mette\u2019s kitchen, the accordion music, the way the Danish flag on her pen felt heavier than it should. She thought about Emmett\u2019s texts, how he described the subway as \u201ca river that runs both ways.\u201d\n\nShe typed:\n\n**For the you that was:** *Zadie, who could see three Starbucks from her window*\n\n**For the you that is:** *Zadie, who can see infinity corn*\n\n**For the you that will be:** *Zadie, who is bad at running away and good at arriving*\n\nShe pressed her thumb to the screen. The phone hummed. The windmill spun.\n\n---\n\nThe app, satisfied, sent them both a receipt. It was a PDF, because even mystical forces need documentation.\n\n**Thank you for your signatures. Your copies have been filed as follows:**\n\n- **Copy 1 (For the place you left):** Has been placed in the archives of the Queens Public Library, Special Collections, under \u201cEphemeral Geography.\u201d\n- **Copy 2 (For the place you are):** Has been laminated and hung in the Danish Windmill\u2019s gift shop, next to the wooden shoe keychains.\n- **Copy 3 (For the place you\u2019re becoming):** Will be delivered by hand. Please be patient. Our courier is a pigeon.\n\nGerald, as if on cue, cooed softly into Zadie\u2019s ear.\n\nEmmett looked up from his phone. The mango guy was back, his bicycle basket now containing only a single sheet of paper. He rode in lazy circles on the street below, not looking up.\n\n\u201cThe courier is a man on a bicycle,\u201d Emmett texted.\n\n\u201cThe courier is a pigeon,\u201d Zadie replied. \u201cHe\u2019s looking at me like I owe him overtime.\u201d\n\nThey both looked at their receipts again. At the bottom, in fine print:\n\n**P.S. The triplicate is a lie. There is only one copy, and you are already holding it.**\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, Emmett found a laminated copy of his signatures hanging in the library, exactly where the app had promised. Doris was dusting it with a cloth.\n\n\u201cNew acquisition,\u201d she said. \u201cSome Iowa boy left his ghost.\u201d\n\nEmmett stared at his own handwriting, permanently preserved beside a first edition of *A Tree Grows in Brooklyn*.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m that Iowa boy,\u201d he said.\n\nDoris didn\u2019t look surprised. \u201cThen you\u2019re late. The mango guy\u2019s been looking for you. Said you forgot your change.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a quarter. It was warm, as if it had been held in someone\u2019s hand for a very long time.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie found her signatures in the windmill gift shop, laminated and hung between a postcard of the corn palace and a wooden shoe that had been made into a birdhouse. Soren was polishing it with beeswax.\n\n\u201cNew addition,\u201d he said. \u201cSome city girl left her map.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m that city girl,\u201d Zadie said.\n\nSoren nodded. \u201cThen you\u2019re early. Gerald\u2019s been waiting for you. Said you promised him a raise.\u201d\n\nThe pigeon was on the counter, standing on a mimeographed form that read **REQUISITION FOR ADDITIONAL SUNFLOWER SEEDS**.\n\nZadie signed it. Once. Twice. Three times.\n\n---\n\nThat night, the app sent one final message. No fanfare. Just a fact.\n\n**The triplicate is complete. You have both signed your names to a place that doesn\u2019t exist yet. It will be built from the following materials:**\n\n**- 1 water stain, cartographic  \n**- 1 wooden shoe, haunted  \n**- 1 mango, delivered  \n**- 1 pigeon, overworked  \n**- 1 MetroCard, bent  \n**- 1 Danish flag, stolen  \n**- 2 signatures, forged from the selves you\u2019re leaving behind**\n\n**Construction begins at dawn. Please have your ghosts ready.**\n\nEmmett sat on the fire escape, the quarter in his palm. He could hear the bakery ovens starting up. He could smell the yeast and the honey and the city\u2019s particular perfume of possibility and garbage. He looked at the water stain on his ceiling. It had shifted again. Now it looked like a windmill.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, Gerald on her pillow. She could hear Mette singing downstairs, something about the sea. She could smell the corn and the cinnamon and the particular perfume of belonging and exile. She looked at the wooden shoe keychain on her nightstand. In the candlelight, it looked like a tiny apartment building.\n\nThey both texted each other at the same time, the messages crossing in the digital ether like two strangers on a stairwell.\n\nEmmett: *I think we\u2019re building something.*\n\nZadie: *I think we\u2019re being built.*\n\nThey didn\u2019t need to see the reply to know what it said. The app had already told them: **The meeting is optional. The finding is not.**\n\nThe quarter in Emmett\u2019s hand grew warm. The wooden shoe in Zadie\u2019s hand grew light. They were both holding the same thing, which was nothing at all, which was everything.\n\nIn triplicate."

      "content": "## Chapter 6: **Welcome to the Flyover State**\n\n*The problem with ghosts is they always know the shortcuts.*\n\n---\n\nEmmett learned the mango guy\u2019s name was Dimitri. He learned this because Dimitri\u2019s bicycle collided with a produce crate on 31st Street and Emmett caught a cascade of nectarines before they could dent on the sidewalk. Dimitri repaid him with a mango and a piece of advice: \u201cYour girl, she always stood here like she was waiting for a bus to somewhere else. You stand like the bus already left.\u201d\n\nIt was 6:47 a.m. The city was a kiln of yeast and exhaust. Emmett ate the mango on the fire escape, watching the bakery\u2019s exhaust fan turn the sky into a watercolor of butter and ash. The water stain on his ceiling had become a windmill overnight\u2014four perfect blades, a tiny Danish flag snapping from its apex. He\u2019d taken a photo and sent it to Zadie. She\u2019d replied with a picture of the wooden shoe keychain, which now looked less like a clog and more like a brownstone with a stoop.\n\n*Construction begins at dawn*, the app had said. Dawn had come and gone, and Emmett was still building something he couldn\u2019t name.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie was learning the difference between field corn and sweet corn. Mette made her shuck a dozen ears before breakfast, the silk clinging to her fingers like ghost hair. \u201cThe ghosts prefer sweet corn,\u201d Mette said, as if this were a known fact. \u201cThey like to whisper through the husks.\u201d\n\nZadie had stopped asking which ghosts. There were the Danish ghosts, the pioneer ghosts, the ghosts of teenagers who\u2019d driven too fast down Highway 173. Elk Horn was a retirement community for the dearly departed, and they all had opinions about the newcomer.\n\nGerald the pigeon had opinions too. He\u2019d moved from the windowsill to the pillow, and now he required a saucer of sunflower seeds before he\u2019d vacate the bed so Zadie could make it. She\u2019d signed his requisition form three times, and now there was a carbon copy in triplicate on Mette\u2019s kitchen counter, stamped **APPROVED BY AVIAN RESOURCES**.\n\nAt 11:23 a.m., the app sent them both the same message:\n\n**You have unlocked: The Tour Guide Quest.**\n**Instructions: Show your ghost the thing they missed.**\n\nZadie read this while standing in the Danish Windmill, the real one, the 60-foot structure that had been shipped over in pieces in 1976. She was supposed to be sweeping the gift shop, but instead she was watching a spider spin a web between a postcard rack and a display of wooden shoes. The spider\u2019s silk caught the sun and turned it into a fiber-optic map of a city that didn\u2019t exist yet.\n\nShe texted Emmett: *What did I miss?*\n\nHe replied: *Everything. You treated it like a waiting room.*\n\nShe thought about that. The way she\u2019d moved through Astoria, through all of Queens, through the entire city like it was a layover. The mango guy. The bakery. The fire escape. They\u2019d been background noise to her real life, which was always happening somewhere else.\n\n*Show me*, she typed.\n\n---\n\nEmmett\u2019s tour began at the Museum of the Moving Image. He\u2019d never been inside, but Zadie\u2019s MetroCard had a faded sticker on the back that said **I \u2764\ufe0f ASTORIA**, and he took it as a sign. The museum had a permanent exhibit on puppetry, and he stood in front of a case containing the actual Skeksis puppet from *The Dark Crystal*. It looked like a ghost that had been fired in a kiln and then given a job in middle management.\n\nHe took a photo. Sent it to Zadie. *You missed the puppets. They\u2019re in charge.*\n\nShe replied: *Gerald says all birds are puppets that cut their strings.*\n\nEmmett looked around. The museum was empty except for a security guard who was reading a Danish phrasebook. The guard looked up. \u201cEr du den nye?\u201d he asked. Are you the new one?\n\nEmmett didn\u2019t speak Danish, but he understood. \u201cJeg tror det,\u201d he said. I think so.\n\nThe guard nodded and went back to his book. Emmett walked through the rest of the exhibit, taking photos of things that seemed like they belonged to Zadie\u2019s ghost: the vintage video games she\u2019d never played, the Jim Henson sketches she\u2019d never seen, the gift shop keychains that looked like tiny wooden shoes.\n\nAt 3:14 p.m., the app sent him a location pin: **The Lemon Ice King of Corona**. He\u2019d never had lemon ice. He\u2019d never been to Corona. He went.\n\nThe line was twenty people deep, and everyone was speaking a language that wasn\u2019t English. Emmett stood behind a man in a trucker hat that said **IOWA**, and felt the universe lean in to wink at him. When he got to the front, he ordered the smallest size. The woman behind the counter gave him a medium. \u201cYou look like you need it,\u201d she said.\n\nHe ate it on the 7 train platform, the sour cold cracking through his molars. The water stain in his apartment had been right: this was a windmill. This whole city was a windmill, turning and turning, grinding experience into flour. You could make bread from it. You could feed yourself.\n\nHe sent Zadie a photo of the lemon ice. *Tastes like homesick.*\n\nShe replied: *Everything does.*\n\n---\n\nZadie\u2019s tour began at the Danish Immigrant Museum, which was technically cheating because she\u2019d already been there, but she figured her ghost had missed the basement. She\u2019d missed the basement. It smelled like mothballs and old paper, and there was a display case containing a single wooden shoe that had belonged to a woman who\u2019d walked from Davenport to Elk Horn in 1871.\n\nThe shoe was carved with initials: **E.A.S.**\n\nZadie\u2019s initials were Z.A.S. The app had called her signature forged from the self she was leaving behind. She wondered if E.A.S. had left a self behind in Denmark, and if that self was still walking, still carving initials into things.\n\nShe took a photo. Sent it to Emmett. *She walked 200 miles in this.*\n\nHe replied: *My great-great-grandmother walked 200 miles to get away from a man who carved initials into trees.*\n\n*Did it work?*\n\n*The trees are still there. So are the initials.*\n\nZadie put her hand on the glass case. The shoe hummed, or maybe that was the furnace. The app buzzed:\n\n**You have found: The Original Ghost.**\n**She is not impressed with your progress.**\n\nZadie laughed. The security guard\u2014maybe the same one from the museum in Queens, maybe not\u2014looked up from his Danish phrasebook. \u201cGhosts are terrible supervisors,\u201d he said in perfect English.\n\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n---\n\nAt midnight, the app appeared with a video call. They both answered before the first ring. The connection was worse this time, pixelated and lagging, as if the signal had to travel through both time zones at once.\n\nEmmett was on the fire escape. Behind him, the city was a constellation of windows, each one a life he wasn\u2019t living. Zadie was in Mette\u2019s kitchen, a candle burning on the table, Gerald pecking at a crumb.\n\n\u201cThe app says I have to show you the thing you missed,\u201d Emmett said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re showing each other,\u201d Zadie said.\n\nThe app typed: **The Flyover State is not a place. It is a perspective. You are both in it.**\n\nEmmett understood. He\u2019d spent his whole life thinking New York was the destination. But to Zadie, it had been a layover. And Iowa\u2014well, Iowa was the place planes flew over. The place people left. The place Emmett had stayed.\n\nZadie understood too. She\u2019d treated Queens like it was temporary. But to Emmett, it was becoming real. And Elk Horn\u2014she was becoming real there, which meant it was becoming real to her.\n\n\u201cI signed the pigeon form in triplicate,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI got lemon ice from the King,\u201d he said.\n\nThe app typed: **You have both accumulated enough points to unlock: The Reason, Part Two.**\n\nZadie\u2019s screen showed: *You were waiting for permission to land.*\n\nEmmett\u2019s screen showed: *You were waiting for permission to leave.*\n\nThey looked at each other through the lag and the pixels. The mango guy\u2019s bicycle was propped against Emmett\u2019s building again. Gerald was on Zadie\u2019s windowsill, a gray ghost checking his watch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d Zadie said. It was the first time she\u2019d said it out loud.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to,\u201d Emmett said.\n\nThe app closed the call. But not before Zadie saw the water stain on Emmett\u2019s ceiling, now clearly a windmill. Not before Emmett saw the wooden shoe on Zadie\u2019s nightstand, now clearly a brownstone.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent them both a final message:\n\n**Construction update: The following materials have been delivered to the site:**\n\n**- 1 lemon ice, medium, sour**\n**- 1 wooden shoe, walked-in, 200 miles**\n**- 1 pigeon, overworked but promoted**\n**- 1 water stain, now operational**\n**- 2 perspectives, adjusted**\n\n**Please note: The Flyover State is now a destination. You are both cleared for landing.**\n\nEmmett sat on the fire escape, the MetroCard warm in his palm. He could hear the bakery ovens cooling. He could smell the yeast settling. The city was no longer a waiting room. It was a place with a pigeon and a windmill and a mango guy who remembered your ghost.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, Gerald on her pillow. She could hear Mette singing upstairs, something about the sea. The sea was a place you could leave and return to. The sea was always there, waiting.\n\nShe texted Emmett: *I think we\u2019re home.*\n\nHe replied: *I think we always were.*\n\nThe app didn\u2019t need to confirm it. The app had already done its job. But it sent one last message anyway, just for the record:\n\n**The meeting is optional. The finding is not. Welcome to the Flyover State, population: you.**\n\nZadie ate a butter cookie shaped like a windmill. Emmett ate a mango, juice running down his wrist. They were both exactly where they were supposed to be: somewhere else, which was turning out to be the same place after all.\n\nThe ghosts were terrible supervisors. But they were excellent architects."

      "content": "## Chapter 7: **This Is What $2,800 a Month Gets You?**\n\n*\"In New York, you don\u2019t pay for square footage. You pay for the square footage of someone else\u2019s memory.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe lease was taped inside the freezer door, next to a photo of a dog that wasn\u2019t Zadie\u2019s and a magnet that read *I \u2764\ufe0f BROOKLYN* in a font that had given up on itself. Emmett found it while looking for ice trays, which didn\u2019t exist because the ice maker had died during the Bush administration. The lease said $2,800/month. Utilities not included. Pets okay if they were \u201cemotional support or smaller than a breadbox.\u201d Gerald, perched on the windowsill, was exactly breadbox-sized and emotionally supported no one.\n\nEmmett did the math. That was 58 hours a month at the bakery, before taxes. More if you counted the mango guy\u2019s habit of \u201cforgetting\u201d to pay for his lemon ice, which Emmett had started covering because the app had sent him a notification that read **Karma is a line item. Please adjust your budget accordingly.**\n\nThe apartment was a fourth-floor walk-up in a building that leaned like it was trying to whisper a secret to the bodega next door. The water stain on the ceiling had become a windmill so precise that Emmett could see the individual blades. It spun when the heat clanked on, which was whenever it felt like it. The floor tilted south. The windows opened inward. The shower had two temperatures: arctic betrayal and lava that remembered your sins.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nThe mango guy had started leaving two mangoes. One for Emmett, one for \u201cthe ghost.\u201d The ghost was Zadie, obviously, but the mango guy called her \u201cthe previous tenant who liked cinnamon.\u201d He\u2019d never met her, but he knew about the cinnamon because the pantry still smelled like it. Emmett had tried to explain that cinnamon didn\u2019t linger like that, but the mango guy just tapped his temple and said, \u201cSpices got memory, kid. Just like buildings.\u201d\n\nAt 7:43 a.m., the app sent an inspection report:\n\n**PROPERTY ASSESSMENT: 4B CHEEVER PLACE**\n**- 1 water stain, operational (windmill, clockwise)**\n**- 1 MetroCard, bent (emotional damage: moderate)**\n**- 1 Danish flag, stolen (sentimental value: incalculable)**\n**- 1 pigeon, overworked (promotion pending)**\n**- 1 mango guy, aware (liability: absolute)**\n**- 1 ghost, present (rent: paid in full)**\n\n**CONCLUSION: You are not subletting. You are being haunted. Please update your renter\u2019s insurance.**\n\nEmmett texted Zadie: *Did you know your apartment costs more than a used Camry?*\n\nShe replied instantly, which meant it was 6:43 a.m. in Iowa and she was already awake. Gerald had trained her. *Did you know my childhood bedroom has a view of a silo that sings when the wind hits it just right?*\n\n*Is that in the lease?*\n\n*It\u2019s in the blood.*\n\n---\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie was learning the difference between a mortgage and a memory. Mette\u2019s house\u2014*their* house, the app kept insisting\u2014had been paid off in 1987 when Mr. Jorgensen won a settlement from a faulty threshing machine. The only monthly payment was to the Danish Brotherhood of America, $22 for \u201ccontinued cultural relevance.\u201d Zadie had tried to pay it online. Mette had handed her a checkbook and a stamp with the Queen of Denmark\u2019s face on it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re building credit,\u201d Mette said, which made no sense but felt true.\n\nThe wooden shoe keychain had started glowing at night. Not dramatically\u2014just a soft amber when Zadie pressed her thumb into the worn heel. The app called it \u201cequity.\u201d Zadie called it \u201cwitchcraft.\u201d Gerald called it \u201ctime for seeds,\u201d which he\u2019d started demanding in triplicate. He\u2019d brought her a form, again, this one titled **REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL PERCHING RIGHTS**. She\u2019d signed it in three places, using three different pens, because the app had sent a follow-up: **Signatures must be materially distinct. Ghosts can spot a forgery.**\n\nAt the Museum of Danish America, Soren had given her a name tag that read *ZADIE, GHOST APPRENTICE*. She spent her days dusting model windmills and learning the proper way to say *hygge* (from the back of the throat, like you\u2019re swallowing a warm thought). Tourists asked if she was \u201cthe New York girl.\u201d She said yes. They took photos. She became a local character, which was what you called a ghost who hadn\u2019t left yet.\n\nThe app sent her a parallel assessment:\n\n**PROPERTY ASSESSMENT: 1426 VINDM\u00d8LLE LANE**\n**- 1 wooden shoe, haunted (mileage: 200 miles)**\n**- 1 pigeon, unionized (grievances: filed)**\n**- 1 quilt, cinnamon-infused (emotional support: certified)**\n**- 1 windmill, singing (tune: unidentifiable but catchy)**\n**- 1 signature, forged from the self you\u2019re leaving behind (valid: yes)**\n\n**CONCLUSION: You are not a tenant. You are a monument. Please advise if you plan to host tours.**\n\n---\n\nAt 9:17 p.m., the mango guy buzzed Emmett\u2019s apartment. Not the building\u2014*the apartment*. He\u2019d figured out the intercom code, which was 4B4B4B, because Zadie had programmed it to be easy to remember. He held up a bag of lemon ice and a question.\n\n\u201cYou gonna stay?\u201d\n\nEmmett was on the fire escape, watering a plant that had appeared that morning. It was a succulent in a coffee mug that said *World\u2019s Okayest Tenant*. The app had left it with a note: **Please care for this ghost. It is drought-resistant but not emotion-resistant.**\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cThe rent\u2019s a hostage situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rent\u2019s the same as it was yesterday,\u201d the mango guy said. \u201cYou\u2019re just looking at it now.\u201d\n\nHe left the lemon ice on the windowsill. It came with a spoon that had *Zadie* engraved on it, which was impossible because it was plastic. Emmett ate it anyway. It tasted like sour nostalgia, which the app later defined as **a flavor profile common to subletters who have inherited someone else\u2019s grocery list.**\n\nInside, the water stain was spinning faster. Emmett could hear it, a faint *whoosh* that synched with the traffic below. He held up the Danish flag\u2014stolen from the Museum of Danish America, technically, though Soren had winked when he took it\u2014and the stain slowed. The app pinged:\n\n**Decorative coordination achieved. Feng shui: Danish modern.**\n\nEmmett laughed. The sound was small in the apartment, which was also small. But the ghost was large. Zadie\u2019s ghost had a laugh that echoed in the cinnamon scent. It had a way of organizing the spice rack by emotional significance. It had left behind a MetroCard that still worked, which was the real magic. Emmett had swiped it that morning. The turnstile had said *GO* but the screen had added, in smaller letters, *HOME?*\n\nHe\u2019d gotten on the Q train. He\u2019d ridden it to the end, to Coney Island, where the wind off the Atlantic smelled like corn and cinnamon. He\u2019d stood on the boardwalk and watched a pigeon that might have been Gerald\u2019s cousin argue with a seagull over a Danish flag napkin.\n\nHe texted Zadie: *I think your ghost is haunting my ghost.*\n\nShe replied: *Good. They can split the rent.*\n\n---\n\nAt 10:30 p.m., the app initiated a video call. No warning. Just Zadie\u2019s face, pale in the candlelight of Mette\u2019s guest room, and Emmett\u2019s face, orange from the streetlight that leaked through the windmill stain.\n\n\u201cThe water stain looks like a brownstone now,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n\u201cThe wooden shoe looks like a subway map,\u201d Emmett said.\n\nThey held up their objects. The MetroCard had a new scratch: a tiny windmill, carved into the magnetic strip. The wooden shoe had a new scuff: the letter Q.\n\n\u201cThe mango guy asked if I was staying,\u201d Emmett said.\n\n\u201cMette asked if I was leaving,\u201d Zadie said.\n\nThey stared at each other. The lag was gone. The pixels had cleared. They were looking through a window, not a screen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re swapping back,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we were supposed to,\u201d Emmett said.\n\nThe app typed for them, but they spoke along:\n\n**The meeting is optional.**\n\n\u201cThe meeting is optional,\u201d they said.\n\n**The finding is not.**\n\n\u201cThe finding is not,\u201d they said.\n\nThe call ended. But the connection didn\u2019t. Emmett could still smell the cornfields. Zadie could still hear the bakery ovens. They were both paying rent in a currency the other had left behind: memory, measured in square feet of ghost.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. Not to Emmett. Not to Zadie. To the mango guy.\n\n**DELIVERY CONFIRMATION: 1 lemon ice, medium, sour. Paid for by: The Previous Tenant.**\n**NOTES: She says you can keep the spoon. She says the rent is worth it if you remember to water the succulent. She says the ghost is optional, but the mango is not.**\n\nThe mango guy looked at his phone, then up at the fourth-floor window where Emmett sat with a pigeon and a windmill and a flag that didn\u2019t belong to him. He nodded, slow, like he was settling a debt.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie blew out the candle. The wooden shoe glowed on the nightstand, a tiny brownstone in the dark. Gerald tucked his head under his wing and dreamed of subway perches and lemon ice.\n\nThey were both paying $2,800 a month. One in dollars. One in dust. Both were terrible deals. Both were worth it.\n\nThe windmill spun. The Q train rattled. The ghosts clocked in for their shift."

      "content": "## Chapter 8: **The Culture Shock Survival Guide**\n\n*Rule #1: The map is not the territory. The territory is also not the map. The map is currently being used as a coaster by a pigeon who has opinions about your life choices.*\n\n---\n\nEmmett learned on his third morning that New York City garbage trucks sang. Not metaphorically\u2014though they did that too, in the key of existential dread\u2014but actually sang, a particular descending wail that meant *your trash is now art, your art is now landfill, and you\u2019re late for the thing you forgot to calendar*. He stood on the fire escape in boxer shorts and a Mette-knitted sweater, holding a bag of pigeon feed and his own inadequacy, while Gerald supervised from the windowsill with the expression of a landlord who\u2019d seen this exact failure before.\n\nThe app had sent instructions at 5:47 a.m.: **Survival Guide Item #3: The city runs on a currency of inconvenience. Pay your dues by being slightly in the way at all times. Bonus points if you smell like yeast.**\n\nEmmett smelled like yeast. Also like the mango guy\u2019s cart, which had become his new coffee shop, his new therapist\u2019s office, his new church. The mango guy\u2014whose name was Luis, though the app still called him \u201cthe mango guy\u201d in all official correspondence\u2014had started leaving a small cup of lemon ice on the fire escape railing every morning, with a note written on MetroCard receipts: *She used to say it cut through the bullshit. You look like you got bullshit.*\n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. Emmett\u2019s bullshit included but was not limited to: a job he\u2019d inherited that involved something called \u201csynergy analytics\u201d (Zadie\u2019s old position, which he understood slightly less than he understood the pigeon\u2019s tax forms), a bodega cat who had claimed his left shoe as a dependent, and a water stain on his ceiling that now looked so much like a windmill he was afraid to look up during Zoom calls in case his coworkers thought he\u2019d moved to Holland.\n\nThe wooden shoe keychain sat on his nightstand. Every night, it grew lighter. Every morning, the MetroCard in his wallet grew heavier, as if absorbing the weight of whatever Zadie was shedding.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie was shedding literal weight. The quilt Mette had made\u2014hand-stitched, heavier than a mortgage\u2014kept sliding off the bed. The wooden floors, which had seemed charmingly creaky on Day One, now spoke in complete sentences: *You\u2019re walking wrong. You\u2019re breathing wrong. You\u2019re Iowa-ing wrong.* The app\u2019s message to her that same morning had been characteristically unhelpful: **Survival Guide Item #3: The fields remember everything. Walk softly and carry a big ghost.**\n\nGerald\u2014*her* Gerald, the one who\u2019d flown 1,200 miles to perch on her windowsill and judge her Danish\u2014had developed a habit of staring at the butter cookie windmills on the kitchen table until Zadie broke one in half and left it for him. He didn\u2019t eat it. He just rearranged the crumbs into what looked suspiciously like a subway map. The Q line, specifically. Zadie recognized it from the scuff on her wooden shoe.\n\nMette had started teaching her to bake *kransekage*, which was less like baking and more like building a tower out of almond paste and hope. \u201cIn Denmark,\u201d Mette said, rolling dough between palms that had seen seventy Iowa winters, \u201cwe make things that last by making things that crumble. You understand?\u201d\n\nZadie did not understand. But she understood that when she spoke, her accent was shifting\u2014her sharp vowels softening, her consonants picking up a lilt that made the locals nod at her like she\u2019d finally learned the password. She understood that the cornfields outside her window were not silent. They whispered in a language of rust and root, and they were learning her name.\n\nThe app sent them both the same message at noon, which was 11 a.m. in Iowa because time, like everything else, was now negotiable:\n\n**Survival Guide Item #4: You are not homesick. You are home-sick. The hyphen is a bridge. Walk across it.**\n\nEmmett read this while standing in a Trader Joe\u2019s line that stretched into next Tuesday. The woman behind him was buying twelve bouquets of eucalyptus and a single container of hummus. The man in front was arguing with the cashier about the philosophical implications of \u201cfair trade\u201d bananas. Emmett\u2019s cart contained: one mango, one sourdough loaf, and a pigeon-feed mix he\u2019d found in Zadie\u2019s Amazon history labeled \u201cFOR GERALD, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE.\u201d\n\nHe was, he realized, impersonating a life. Badly.\n\nZadie read the message while trying to parallel park Mette\u2019s tractor in the grocery store lot. The tractor didn\u2019t have a reverse gear, or maybe it did and she just couldn\u2019t find it behind the existential terror of being the woman who\u2019d just driven a tractor to buy almond paste. A man in a John Deere hat gave her a thumbs-up. She gave him a finger-gun back. It was, she was learning, the Iowa equivalent of a firm handshake.\n\nLater, they video-called. Not because they needed to. Because the app had started charging them for *not* calling, deducting invisible fees from their ghost-rent accounts.\n\n\u201cThe water stain is definitely a windmill now,\u201d Emmett said, angling his phone up. \u201cGerald keeps trying to roost on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wooden shoe is definitely a brownstone,\u201d Zadie said, holding hers to the camera. The Q scuff had deepened, now connecting to a scratch that looked like the 7 train. \u201cMette asked if I wanted to paint it. I think she thinks it\u2019s a craft project.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s a craft project here. They made a scarecrow that looks like the mayor. It\u2019s more accurate than the mayor is.\u201d\n\nEmmett laughed. The sound echoed in his tiny apartment, bouncing off the water stain, the MetroCard, the ghost of Zadie\u2019s ambition that still lived in the synergy analytics spreadsheets. \u201cI got a care package from Mette. Butter cookies. They taste like\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Like if nostalgia had a crunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got one from Luis. Lemon ice. He said you\u2019d understand.\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other. The lag was back, but different now\u2014less digital stutter, more purposeful pause, like the connection was taking a breath.\n\n\u201cI think the ghosts are building us a door,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n\u201cI think the door is already here,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cWe\u2019re just on opposite sides of it.\u201d\n\nThe app typed beneath their faces: **Survival Guide Item #5: A door is just a wall with commitment issues.**\n\nThat evening, Emmett discovered the true meaning of culture shock: it wasn\u2019t the subway or the price of eggs or the fact that his neighbor practiced opera at 2 a.m. It was the bodega. Specifically, it was the bodega cat\u2014now officially named \u201cDependent Shoe\u201d\u2014bringing him a dead mouse and dropping it at his feet with a look that said *welcome to the food chain, corn boy*.\n\nHe texted Zadie a picture. She replied with a photo of Gerald, who had caught a grasshopper and was attempting to teach it to tap dance on the windowsill.\n\n**Survival Guide Item #6: Predators and prey are just roommates with different schedules.**\n\nZadie\u2019s culture shock came at the town hall meeting, where she learned that Elk Horn had a committee for everything. A committee for the windmill. A committee for the butter cookie festival. A committee for committees. They asked her opinion on the new bike rack. She said, \u201cDoes anyone here even bike?\u201d They nodded, solemn. She had given the correct answer. The correct answer was always a question that proved you were paying attention to the subtext.\n\nMette squeezed her hand under the table. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine, city mouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a pigeon supervisor,\u201d Zadie whispered back.\n\n\u201cSame thing.\u201d\n\nBack in the city, Emmett was learning that pigeon supervision involved paperwork. Gerald had left a form on his keyboard: **REQUISITION FOR ADDITIONAL FIRE ESCAPE REAL ESTATE (ATTACHED: FEATHERED DEPENDENT).** Emmett signed it. The printer, which had not worked since 2019, whirred to life and spat out a duplicate. He signed that too. The MetroCard in his wallet pulsed warm.\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. Not to Emmett. Not to Zadie. To the ghosts.\n\n**ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE: The following materials have been successfully integrated:**\n\n**- 1 city boy, softened**\n**- 1 country girl, sharpened**\n**- 1 pigeon, bilingual**\n**- 1 water stain, zoned residential**\n**- 1 wooden shoe, rent-controlled**\n**- 2 perspectives, now load-bearing**\n\n**Please note: The tenants have stopped asking for directions. They have started building. The meeting is optional. The finding is not. The rent is due in triplicate.**\n\nEmmett sat on the fire escape, the MetroCard in his palm. The windmill stain spun slowly, casting a shadow that looked like a cornfield. In Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, the wooden shoe on her chest. The Q train rattled through its scuff mark, singing a song about garbage and possibility.\n\nThey were both exactly where they were supposed to be: lost, found, and terrible at supervising ghosts.\n\nThe ghosts, for their part, were excellent landlords. They\u2019d just raised the rent."

      "title": "**The First Video Call Disaster**",
      "content": "## Chapter 9: **The First Video Call Disaster**\n\n*\"The blue circle spins. The connection is buffering. The self is loading.\"*\n\n---\n\nZadie had learned to butter-coat her expectations. It was an Elk Horn skill: you didn\u2019t ask for sunshine, you asked for *partly cloudy with a chance of enough light to find the shed keys*. So when the app pinged\u2014**VIDEO CALL REQUEST: ACCEPT ARCHITECTURAL INSPECTION?**\u2014she accepted the way she accepted the town\u2019s butter cookie festival committee: with a mug of Mette\u2019s chamomile tea and the quiet certainty that something would go slightly, charmingly wrong.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Emmett accepted the call while balancing a mango on his knee. The mango guy had started leaving fruit on the fire escape, unasked. Payment, maybe, for the ghost stories Emmett told him about cornfields that whispered. The mango was perfectly ripe. The call was perfectly timed. The pigeon on his shoulder\u2014Gerald, who had flown in through the windmill stain\u2014was perfectly asleep.\n\nThe screen resolved.\n\nFor a moment, everything was crisp. Zadie\u2019s quilt was visible down to the elk-shaped stitching. Emmett\u2019s fire escape rust showed every flake of orange. They could see each other\u2019s pores, the hangnail on Zadie\u2019s thumb, the lemon ice stain on Emmett\u2019s t-shirt that hadn\u2019t washed out.\n\nThen the lag hit.\n\nNot the usual half-second delay, the kind that made them speak in accidental rounds. This was *architectural* lag. Zadie\u2019s words left her mouth and hung in the air above Emmett\u2019s screen, literal subtitles made of dust motes. Emmett\u2019s blink took three seconds to complete, and when his eyes reopened, they were Zadie\u2019s eyes\u2014green instead of brown, wide with a city\u2019s perpetual alertness.\n\n\u201cThe app\u2019s glitching,\u201d Zadie said. Her voice arrived in Emmett\u2019s apartment a full minute later, distorted, as if it had traveled through the water stain on his ceiling. It dripped onto his forehead.\n\nEmmett wiped it away. \u201cI think we\u2019re the glitch.\u201d\n\nOn his screen, Zadie\u2019s background was doing something it shouldn\u2019t. The wooden shoe on her nightstand was casting a shadow that looked like the Manhattan skyline. The shadow moved. The shoe didn\u2019t.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie watched Emmett\u2019s fire escape start to pixelate. Not in the digital sense\u2014in the *actual* sense. The metal slats broke into tiny squares and began rearranging themselves into a pattern she recognized from the town hall\u2019s linoleum floor. The pattern was voting on something. The pattern was a committee.\n\n**CONNECTION UNSTABLE**, the app typed. **PLEASE HOLD WHILE WE RECALIBRATE YOUR PERSPECTIVES.**\n\nThe pigeon woke up. Gerald looked at the screen, then at Emmett, then at the mango. He made a sound like a dial-up modem.\n\n\u201cGerald?\u201d Emmett said.\n\nThe pigeon pecked the screen. Zadie felt it on her end\u2014a sharp tap on her collarbone, right where a bird might perch on a subway railing. She looked down. There was a feather there, translucent, made of Wi-Fi signals.\n\n\u201cThis is new,\u201d she said.\n\nEmmett\u2019s voice arrived before his lips moved. \u201cThis is a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe screen split\u2014not into two images, but into two *times*. On the left, Zadie saw Emmett as he was: fire escape, mango, pigeon. On the right, she saw him as he *had been*: cornfields, a younger face, a blue pickup truck that still ran. The right-side Emmett was waving at her. The left-side Emmett was trying to close the app. Neither could see the other.\n\n\u201cEmmett,\u201d Zadie said, careful now, the way you speak to a spooked animal. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not moving,\u201d said two Emmetts, in stereo.\n\nOn his screen, Zadie was also splitting. Left-side Zadie was in Elk Horn, under the quilt. Right-side Zadie was in a Brooklyn apartment she recognized\u2014*her* old apartment, the one she\u2019d sublet, the one with the succulent she\u2019d forgotten to water. Right-side Zadie was watering it. The succulent was dead. Right-side Zadie was crying, but the tears were made of static.\n\n**USER ERROR DETECTED**, the app announced. **PLEASE REINSERT YOURSELF INTO THE CORRECT TIMELINE.**\n\n\u201cThe app thinks we\u2019re in the wrong bodies,\u201d Emmett said. His voice was overlapping now, a chorus of past and present. \u201cThe app thinks we made a mistake.\u201d\n\nZadie clutched the wooden shoe. The Q train scuff mark was hot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make a mistake. We made a *choice*.\u201d\n\n**CHOICES ARE NOT LOAD-BEARING**, the app replied. **PLEASE SUBMIT FORM 27-B: REQUEST FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S FOOTPRINT.**\n\nA form materialized on Emmett\u2019s keyboard. It was made of dried mango skin. The questions were:\n\n1. *Are you the person you are pretending to be? (If no, please attach proof of purchase.)*\n2. *Does your ghost have a forwarding address?*\n3. *In the event of a swap reversal, who keeps the memories?*\n\nGerald pecked at question three. The answer he typed was: *The pigeon decides.*\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Emmett said. He tried to close the form. It stapled itself to his palm.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie\u2019s wooden shoe was vibrating. The brownstone shadow it cast was now three-dimensional, a tiny apartment building growing out of her nightstand like a mushroom. She could see into the windows. In one of them, a ghost was taking a shower. The ghost looked like her mother, who had never visited Elk Horn, who had never approved of corn.\n\n\u201cEmmett,\u201d Zadie said, and now her voice was split too\u2014one layer Brooklyn-brisk, one layer Iowa-slow. \u201cI think we\u2019re breaking the app.\u201d\n\n**THE APP IS NOT BROKEN**, the app corrected. **THE APP IS A MIRROR. YOU ARE BREAKING YOURSELVES.**\n\nThe call froze. Not the image\u2014the *people*. Emmett\u2019s hand, mid-reach for the mango, stuck in the air. Zadie\u2019s blink, mid-blink, left her with one eye open, one eye closed. The world on each side of the screen began to leak.\n\nA cornstalk grew through Emmett\u2019s floorboards. It was polite. It knocked first.\n\nA subway token rolled out from under Zadie\u2019s quilt. It was rude. It swore at her in MTA announcements.\n\nThe mango guy knocked on Emmett\u2019s window. He was holding a spoon. \u201cShe says you need to stir,\u201d he said, pointing at the screen. \u201cThe connection\u2019s separating.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeparating into what?\u201d Emmett\u2019s mouth moved, but the voice came from Zadie\u2019s throat.\n\nThe mango guy shrugged. \u201cParts. You\u2019re becoming ingredients.\u201d\n\nMette appeared behind Zadie, holding a butter cookie shaped like a router. \u201cThe committee voted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a committee anymore. We\u2019re a construction crew.\u201d\n\n**CONSTRUCTION CREW ACTIVATED**, the app agreed. **PLEASE STAND BY WHILE WE DEMOLISH YOUR PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS.**\n\nThe screen went black. Not off\u2014*black*, like fresh asphalt. Then words appeared, typed in real time, as if someone was writing them with a very careful finger:\n\n*Once upon a time, a boy from Iowa and a girl from NYC exchanged places. This was not a mistake. This was a blueprint. But blueprints are not buildings. You have to build the building yourself. With your hands. And your ghosts. And your terrible, wonderful, load-bearing choices.*\n\nThe call reconnected.\n\nEmmett was in Elk Horn. Zadie was in Brooklyn.\n\nJust for a second. Just long enough to feel the air change\u2014the humidity of corn versus the density of brick. Just long enough for Emmett to see the actual windmill, spinning, and for Zadie to see the actual Q train, rattling. Just long enough for them to panic.\n\nThen they snapped back.\n\nBut they brought souvenirs.\n\nEmmett\u2019s fire escape now had a small plaque: **HISTORIC SITE: PIGEON SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE, EST. 2024.** It was written in Danish.\n\nZadie\u2019s wooden shoe had a new smell: mango, cut with subway brake dust.\n\nGerald, the pigeon, was now bilingual. He cooed in iambic pentameter.\n\n**DISASTER CONTAINED**, the app reported. **MOSTLY.**\n\nThe video call stabilized. Their faces were their own again. But the backgrounds had negotiated a treaty. Emmett\u2019s corner of the screen showed a sliver of cornfield. Zadie\u2019s showed a ghost of the fire escape.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Emmett said, his voice finally synced to his mouth, \u201cwe need new rules.\u201d\n\nZadie nodded. \u201cRule one: no more calls at midnight. The ghosts are management. They\u2019re not supposed to be on the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cRule two,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cWe stop pretending we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n**RULE TWO APPROVED**, the app typed. **PLEASE NOTE: IGNORANCE IS NOW LOAD-BEARING.**\n\nThey sat in silence, breathing each other\u2019s air through the screen. The panic had left a residue, like the film on a kettle that\u2019s boiled dry. It tasted like lemon ice and butter cookies and the realization that they had built something without a permit.\n\n\u201cThe mango guy says the rent\u2019s going up,\u201d Emmett said.\n\n\u201cMette says the dust is due,\u201d Zadie said.\n\nThey both looked at their objects. The MetroCard\u2019s windmill scratch was deeper now, carved by something sharper than a key. The wooden shoe\u2019s Q train scuff had multiplied. It was a whole line. It was the whole system.\n\n**FINAL NOTE**, the app wrote. **THE DISASTER WAS NOT A BUG. IT WAS A LOAD TEST. YOU BOTH HELD. CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR GHOSTS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO PARTNERS.**\n\nGerald the pigeon, now a partner, pooped on Emmett\u2019s keyboard. It was a contract. It was binding.\n\nZadie blew out her candle. The flame jumped to Emmett\u2019s screen, burned there for a moment, then went out. They were both in the dark, but they could see each other perfectly.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Emmett,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Zadie,\u201d Emmett said.\n\nThe call ended. But the connection hummed, a low frequency, like a windmill spinning in a place with no wind. Like a train running on a track made of butter cookies. Like two people who had just learned that home is a structure you build with mismatched parts, and that sometimes the foundation is made of disaster.\n\nIn the morning, the mango guy would leave a spoon on Emmett\u2019s windowsill. In Elk Horn, Mette would find a subway token in the butter cookie dough. The ghosts would hold a meeting. The meeting would be optional.\n\nThe finding would not.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent a message to both of them. Not a group text. Two separate messages, identical in content but different in tone, the way a translation can change the meaning of a love letter.\n\n**To: Emmett**\n**Subject: Your Disaster Assessment**\n**The girl from NYC is not a tenant. She is a structural requirement. Please stop trying to uninstall her. The cornfields miss you, but they understand. They have voted to grant you permanent residency in the place you are pretending to be. The mango is non-negotiable.**\n\n**To: Zadie**\n**Subject: Your Disaster Assessment**\n**The boy from Iowa is not a placeholder. He is a load-bearing wall. Please stop trying to sublet him. The subway misses you, but it\u2019s learning to whistle. It has voted to grant you permanent residency in the place you are pretending to leave. The wooden shoe is rent-controlled.**\n\nThey read the messages in their respective darks. They did not reply. They did not need to.\n\nThe disaster had been a test. They had passed by failing to hold themselves apart.\n\nThe ghosts, terrible supervisors, excellent architects, clocked out for the night. They left the blue circle spinning, just in case.\n\nIt spun. It spun. It found them, exactly where they were: home, which was somewhere else, which was turning out to be the same place after all, which was a disaster, which was perfect."

The real trouble starts when you forget how to swim.*\n\n---\n\nZadie\u2019s first official duty as Pigeon Supervisor of Elk Horn was to adjudicate a dispute between a mourning dove and a pair of sparrows over a prime nesting location in the windmill\u2019s upper gearbox. The sparrows had paperwork\u2014twigs arranged in a formation that, if you squinted, looked like a signed lease. The dove had seniority and a single, devastating feather left on the sill as a gesture of grief.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be supervising pigeons,\u201d Mette said, handing her a thermos of coffee that tasted like burnt toast and forgiveness.\n\n\u201cThe pigeons unionized,\u201d Zadie said. \u201cThey\u2019re on break.\u201d\n\nThis was true. Gerald had sent a delegate\u2014a stout bird with a MetroCard clipped to its leg\u2014who delivered a typed memo: **WE DEMAND SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND A FOUR-HOUR WORKDAY. THE FIRE ESCAPE IS NOT A MONARCHY. SINCERELY, LOCAL 401.** Zadie had stamped it APPROVED with the butter cookie festival committee\u2019s seal, which she\u2019d borrowed and immediately lost.\n\nIn New York, Emmett was learning that fire escape real estate was a cutthroat market. Gerald had sublet the eastern railing to a family of starlings who paid in bottle caps and insider information about which Chinese takeout place dumped the best leftover dumplings. The western railing was under negotiation with a squirrel who claimed squatters\u2019 rights and had a lawyer\u2014an actual lawyer, a guy from the fifth floor who\u2019d passed the bar and then decided to represent urban wildlife pro bono.\n\n\u201cThe squirrel says you owe him three pistachios and a guarantee of safe passage during the next Nor\u2019easter,\u201d Emmett read from a note pinned to his windowsill with a mango seed.\n\nThe mango guy, whose name was apparently just \u201cMango\u201d according to the Sharpie on his apron, had started leaving things. A spoon. A lemon ice coupon. A tiny succulent in a yogurt cup with a Post-it: *She says you\u2019re overwatering. She says the ghost likes it dry.*\n\nEmmett didn\u2019t know who \u201cshe\u201d was. He suspected he did, but knowing and suspecting were different time zones.\n\nBack in Elk Horn, Zadie was losing a battle with a butter cookie press that had been in commission since the Eisenhower administration. It required a specific prayer, a specific wrist angle, and what Mette called \u201cthe spirit of cooperative despair.\u201d The cookies came out shaped like tiny windmills, but if you pressed too hard, they looked like the Chrysler Building having an existential crisis.\n\n\u201cThe secret,\u201d Mette said, \u201cis to let the dough think it\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nZadie\u2019s phone buzzed. Not the app\u2014the app only spoke at 12:04 a.m., like a bat signal for the emotionally unmoored. This was a text from a number she didn\u2019t recognize: **(646) 555-0147**. It said: *Your pigeon is eating my everything bagel. He has excellent taste. Please advise.*\n\nShe looked out the bakery window. Gerald\u2019s delegate was perched on the windowsill, beak dusted with poppy seeds, looking extremely pleased with itself.\n\nZadie typed back: *Give him the everything bagel. He\u2019s on salary.*\n\nThe reply was instant: *He says salary is a construct. He wants equity.*\n\n*Of course he does,* Zadie thought. *He\u2019s from New York.*\n\nShe sent a final message: *Tell him the rent is due in triplicate. He\u2019ll understand.*\n\nIn his apartment, Emmett\u2019s phone buzzed. The same number\u2014now showing up as **(712) 555-0198**\u2014sent him a photo of a butter cookie shaped like a windmill with a Q train scuffed into its center. The caption read: *She says the ghosts voted. You\u2019re now officially on the committee for the butter cookie festival. Meeting is optional. Finding is not.*\n\nEmmett had never been on a committee. He\u2019d never been on a *festival*. The most organized thing he\u2019d done in Iowa was help his dad rotate the tires on the combine and that had ended with a lug nut lost to the cornfields, which his dad said was \u201ca sacrifice to the harvest gods.\u201d\n\nHe typed: *I don\u2019t know how to make butter cookies.*\n\nThe reply: *Neither does she. That\u2019s the point.*\n\n---\n\nThe water stain on Emmett\u2019s ceiling had developed neighborhoods. The brownstone had a stoop now. The windmill had a tiny, defiant flag. He\u2019d started talking to it, which was fine, because in New York talking to your ceiling was only the seventh-weirdest thing your neighbors were doing at any given moment. Mrs. Chen from 3B was learning the bagpipes. Someone on the sixth floor was breeding silkworms. The guy directly below Emmett had a podcast about the secret lives of parking meters.\n\nEmmett\u2019s podcast was about pigeons. He\u2019d recorded three episodes: **Episode 1: Gerald and the Great MetroCard Heist**, **Episode 2: Squirrel Law: A Primer**, and **Episode 3: The Mango Guy Is Not a Metaphor (Or Is He?)**. He had zero listeners but seventeen ghost subscribers, which he knew because the app had sent him a notification: **YOUR PODCAST HAS BEEN ARCHIVED BY THE TENANTS. THEY FIND YOUR VOICE SOOTHING. THEY HAVE VOTED TO RENEW YOUR LEASE IN PERPETUITY.**\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what that meant. He suspected it meant he was never leaving.\n\nIn Elk Horn, Zadie had been voluntold to join the committee for the windmill. This involved meetings at the library basement where the coffee was always Folgers and the agenda was always existential. They discussed the windmill\u2019s tilt (three degrees off, \u201ccharacter-building\u201d), its paint (faded, \u201cauthentic\u201d), and its ghost (present, \u201crude\u201d).\n\n\u201cDoes every building have a ghost?\u201d Zadie asked.\n\n\u201cNot every building,\u201d said the chair, a man named Lars who wore a seed corn cap indoors. \u201cBut every structure has a memory. Some are just louder than others.\u201d\n\nZadie thought of her brownstone in Brooklyn, the way the stairs creaked in a pattern that sounded like her mother\u2019s footsteps. The way the radiator hissed her name. The way the mango guy had looked at her like she was a story he was trying to finish.\n\n\u201cThe windmill\u2019s memory,\u201d Lars said, \u201cis that it used to be somewhere else. Whole thing was shipped over from Denmark in 1976. Took six months to reassemble. Some parts are still missing. We think they\u2019re in the ghost.\u201d\n\nZadie looked at the wooden shoe on the table. It had a new scuff: a tiny, perfect mango.\n\n---\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent two messages. Not to Emmett and Zadie. To the objects.\n\n**To: MetroCard**  \n*The wooden shoe has been promoted to co-chair of the butter cookie festival. It requests your attendance. Please bring seeds.*\n\n**To: Wooden Shoe**  \n*The MetroCard has been subpoenaed by Squirrel Law. It requests your testimony. Please bring crumbs.*\n\nEmmett found his MetroCard vibrating in his wallet. The tiny windmill carved into the magnetic strip was spinning. He held it up to the light. Through the scratch, he could see Zadie\u2019s kitchen in Elk Horn, the butter cookie press, the ghost of a flour fight.\n\nZadie\u2019s wooden shoe was glowing on the nightstand. The Q train scuff had become a portal, a tiny window into Emmett\u2019s fire escape, where Gerald and the starlings were holding what looked like a board meeting. One starling had a PowerPoint. It was just twigs, but the twigs were *very* organized.\n\nThey called each other without dialing.\n\n\u201cThe app is talking to my MetroCard,\u201d Emmett said.\n\n\u201cThe app is talking to my shoe,\u201d Zadie said.\n\nThey paused. The lag was back, but it was different now. Not a delay. A depth.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re the app now,\u201d Zadie said.\n\n\u201cI think we always were,\u201d Emmett said.\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, Zadie discovered a subway token in the butter cookie dough. It was old, the kind you couldn\u2019t use anymore, but when she held it, she heard the Q train rattling through the dough, singing about garbage and possibility. She pressed it into a cookie. The cookie came out perfect.\n\nEmmett found a windmill carved into his windowsill, right where the mango guy left the spoon. It was small, precise, the work of a pocketknife and a patient hand. When he traced it with his finger, he smelled cornfields and coffee that tasted like burnt toast.\n\nThe mango guy looked up from his cart and nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s learning,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLearning what?\u201d Emmett asked.\n\n\u201cHow to build with butter,\u201d Mango said. \u201cHow to live in a structure made of missing parts.\u201d\n\nIn Elk Horn, Mette looked at the subway token cookie and said, \u201cHe\u2019s learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cLearning what?\u201d Zadie asked.\n\n\u201cHow to supervise a ghost,\u201d Mette said. \u201cHow to pay rent in a currency that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThe fish-out-of-water feeling didn\u2019t go away. It deepened. Zadie learned to breathe the air of a place where everyone knew your business and that was a kind of love. Emmett learned to swim in a sea of strangers and that was a kind of freedom.\n\nThey were both still terrible at supervising ghosts. The ghosts, for their part, had given up on supervision and moved on to architecture. They were building a bridge between a windmill and a brownstone, between a MetroCard and a wooden shoe, between a girl who thought she needed to leave and a boy who thought he needed to stay.\n\nThe bridge was made of butter cookies and mango spoons, of pigeon feathers and squirrel law, of water stains and flour ghosts.\n\nIt was a terrible design. It was perfect.\n\nAt 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. To both of them, but also to itself.\n\n**ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE: The fish have learned to walk. The birds have learned to swim. The tenants have stopped paying rent in memory. They have started paying it in momentum. The meeting is optional. The finding is not. The structure is load-bearing. The disaster is complete.**\n\nEmmett sat on his fire escape, holding a butter cookie that tasted like the Q train. Zadie sat in the windmill\u2019s shadow, holding a MetroCard that spun like a tiny, defiant flag.\n\nThey were both exactly where they were supposed to be: out of water, out of air, building a third thing that was neither and both.\n\nThe ghosts clocked in for their shift. They were excellent architects. They\u2019d just approved the blueprints.\n\nThe blueprints were blank. The tenants would fill them in."
