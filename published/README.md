# Published Novels

This directory contains finalized novels that have been published through the Kimi Book Writer UI.

## Structure

Each novel is stored as a Markdown file with the following naming convention:
- `{title-slug}.md` - The full novel content

## Publishing Process

Novels are generated in the `preview/` directory (gitignored) and can be published through the web UI:
1. Generate a novel using the Generate tab
2. Review the novel in the Library tab
3. Click "Publish" to move it here and commit it to the repository

## Reading

You can read published novels:
- Through the web UI (Library → Published section)
- Directly by opening the `.md` files in any Markdown viewer
- On GitHub's web interface (rendered automatically)
