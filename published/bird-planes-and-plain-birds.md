## Chapter 1: **Elsewhere, USA: A Novel**

*"Every map has an elsewhere. The trick is finding the dotted line."*

Zadie Patel’s apartment was so small she could make coffee, answer emails, and water her dying ficus without taking her socks off. This was less a boast about multitasking and more a literal description of the seven-foot radius she inhabited every morning, a radius that currently smelled of burnt toast and yesterday’s regrets.

“No, Brian, I *cannot* push the meeting to three,” she said into her phone, pinning it between her shoulder and ear while performing the aforementioned coffee-email-ficus trifecta. “Because three is when I have my other meeting. Yes, the one about the book about the dog who solves crypto crimes. No, I don’t think it’s ‘derivative.’ I think it’s *pioneering*.”

She hung up before her boss could argue further. The ficus dropped a leaf in protest. Zadie stared at it, wondering if this was what her life had become: negotiating with a middle-aged man about canine blockchain fiction in a studio where her bed was also her couch was also her dining table.

Outside, Manhattan roared its usual symphony—sirens, delivery bikes, a man yelling about the price of everything bagels. Zadie had lived in this same fifth-floor walk-up in Astoria for six years, ever since graduating from NYU with a degree in Comparative Literature and a delusional belief that she would somehow afford a one-bedroom by twenty-five. Now twenty-eight, she could afford exactly one thing: the rent, and only if she ate primarily lentils and stopped buying the *good* toilet paper.

Her phone buzzed. Not Brian—worse. Her mother.

*Beta, have you considered the dental school application? Dr. Mehta’s son is single and makes very good salary.*

Zadie typed back: *Still happy in publishing, Ma. Please stop fixing my teeth and my love life simultaneously.*

She tossed the phone onto her “desk”—a plank of wood balanced across two filing cabinets—and opened her laptop. The screen glowed with the familiar hellscape of her inbox: manuscript rejections, meeting invites, a newsletter from a bookstore she’d never visited. And there, sandwiched between an offer for discounted Viagra and a LinkedIn request from someone she’d ghosted in 2019, was an ad.

**TIRED OF YOUR ZIP CODE?** it read, in a font that suggested both whimsy and mild hallucination. **EXCHANGE LIVES WITH SOMEONE ELSEWHERE. USA ONLY. NO TAKEBACKS.**

Zadie almost deleted it. She’d seen stranger scams—there was that time someone offered to pay her in “exposure” to ghostwrite a memoir for a ferret. But something about the specificity of “no takebacks” made her pause. She clicked.

The website was minimalist to the point of suspicion. A single page, cream-colored, with a form that asked only three questions:

1. *What do you want to leave?*
2. *What are you willing to find?*
3. *How long is forever?*

“Okay, this is definitely a cult,” Zadie muttered. But her cursor hovered over the first field. What *did* she want to leave? The email pinged again—Brian, asking if she could “just quickly” read a 400-page manuscript about a sentient cruise ship. The ficus dropped another leaf. Downstairs, someone began practicing the trumpet.

She typed: *The noise. The hustle that feels less like ambition and more like panic in a blazer. The way my apartment is shrinking one square inch per day.*

For the second question, she hesitated. What was she willing to find? Silence? Space? A life where her worth wasn’t measured in how many manuscripts she could devour before lunch?

She wrote: *Room to breathe. A sky that isn’t sliced into rectangles by buildings. A version of myself that doesn’t flinch when her phone buzzes.*

The third question was nonsense. Forever? She typed: *Six months. Maybe. Probably. I don’t know.*

She hit submit before she could think better of it. The page refreshed to a single line: **APPLICATION RECEIVED. MATCHING YOUR DISSATISFACTION.**

“Great,” Zadie said to the ficus. “I’ve been matched with a serial killer in Nebraska.”

Three hundred and twenty-seven miles west, Emmett Larsen was watching a thunderstorm roll across his father’s cornfield like it owed him money. The clouds were the color of a bruise, heavy and mean, and he could already hear the wind picking up, whistling through the gaps in the old farmhouse windows.

“She’s gonna be a gullywasher,” his dad called from the porch, using the kind of meteorological terminology that had been passed down through five generations of Larsens. “Better get the shutters.”

Emmett nodded, but he didn’t move. He was standing in the middle of the driveway, barefoot, feeling the first fat drops of rain hit his shoulders. At twenty-seven, he’d spent his entire life in this same house, on this same land, in this same town of 1,042 people who all knew his business before he did. He’d gone to Iowa State for agronomy, come home to help his dad after the heart attack, and somehow never left. The temporary had become permanent, the way it always did in small towns.

His phone buzzed. A text from his ex-girlfriend, now married to his former high school teammate: *Saw ur truck at the co-op. Hope ur doing ok!*

The subtext: *I am thriving and you are still buying feed in the same flannel you wore in 2016.*

Emmett didn’t answer. The rain was coming harder now, and he could smell it—that clean, electric scent of ozone and dirt that meant the world was about to refresh itself. He loved that smell. He also hated that he loved it, because loving it meant he was exactly where he was supposed to be, and where he was supposed to be felt like a shirt that had shrunk in the wash.

Inside, the house was quiet. His dad was napping in the recliner, the TV murmuring about soybean futures. Emmett’s laptop sat open on the kitchen table, where he’d been updating the farm’s spreadsheets—an endless parade of numbers that told him they were barely breaking even, that the land was tired, that he was tired.

He sat down, meaning to close it, but his email was still up. And there, between a message from the Farm Bureau and a coupon for Tractor Supply, was an ad.

**TIRED OF YOUR ZIP CODE?** it asked, in a font that looked like it had been handwritten by someone who still wrote letters. **EXCHANGE LIVES WITH SOMEONE ELSEWHERE. USA ONLY. NO TAKEBACKS.**

Emmett laughed. It was the first real laugh he’d had in days. Exchange lives? Sure. He’d trade his 4 a.m. alarm and his dad’s medical bills and the way everyone in town looked at him with a mixture of pity and expectation for… what? A penthouse? A subway card? A job where he didn’t have to check the radar every ten minutes?

He clicked. The questions were simple:

1. *What do you want to leave?*
2. *What are you willing to find?*
3. *How long is forever?*

The rain pounded the roof. His dad snored softly. Emmett thought about the text from his ex, about the spreadsheets, about the way the horizon here was so flat you could see tomorrow coming and it looked exactly like today.

He typed: *The silence that isn’t peaceful, just empty. The way everyone knows my story before I get to tell it. The feeling that I’m living a life that was handed to me, not one I chose.*

For the second question, he paused. What did he want to find? Noise? Chaos? A place where no one knew his name or his father’s name or his grandfather’s name?

He wrote: *The chance to be new. To be anonymous. To be somewhere that doesn’t feel like a memory I’m stuck in.*

For the third, he typed: *Six months. Maybe. Probably. I don’t know.*

He hit submit. The screen went white, then displayed: **APPLICATION RECEIVED. MATCHING YOUR DISSATISFACTION.**

The lights flickered. The storm was directly overhead now, shaking the old house. Emmett’s dad woke up with a snort. “Power out?”

“Not yet,” Emmett said, but he was still staring at the screen. It felt like a dare. Or a mistake. Or maybe just the first interesting thing that had happened to him since the county fair’s butter sculpture contest.

---

Zadie’s confirmation email arrived at 6:47 p.m., just as she was stepping over a puddle of what she hoped was melted ice cream on the N train. It was brief:

**CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR DISSATISFACTION HAS BEEN MATCHED.**
**DESTINATION: ELK HORN, IOWA (POP. 1,042)**
**DEPARTURE: JUNE 1ST. PACK LIGHT. LEAVE YOUR EXPECTATIONS.**

She almost deleted it. Elk Horn, Iowa? She’d never heard of it. But she googled it anyway, standing in the swaying subway car, and found a Wikipedia page that looked like it had been last updated during the Bush administration. There was a photo of a windmill. Another of a cornfield. A third of a sign that read: *VELKOMMEN TIL ELK HORN*—apparently it was the largest Danish settlement in America.

“Perfect,” she muttered. “I’m being traded to Viking corn country.”

Her phone rang. Brian. She let it go to voicemail.

---

Emmett’s email arrived at 5:47 p.m. Central time, which was, he noted, the exact moment the storm broke and the sun came out, turning everything steamy and gold.

**CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR DISSATISFACTION HAS BEEN MATCHED.**
**DESTINATION: ASTORIA, QUEENS, NEW YORK (POP. 95,000 GIVE OR TAKE)**
**DEPARTURE: JUNE 1ST. PACK LIGHT. LEAVE YOUR EXPECTATIONS.**

He stared at it for a long time. Then he googled Astoria and found pictures of crowded streets, a subway line he’d never heard of, and an apartment listing for a studio that cost more per month than his truck.

His dad shuffled into the kitchen, smelling of rain and sleep. “What’s that face for? We lose the south field?”

“No,” Emmett said slowly. “I think I just signed up to be someone else for a while.”

His dad squinted at the screen. “That one of those reality TV shows? You gonna be on the TV?”

“Maybe,” Emmett lied. “Probably not. I don’t know.”

The old man nodded, as if this made perfect sense. “Well. Don’t forget to empty the dehumidifier before you go.”

Emmett looked out the window at the field, at the rows of corn stretching away like green soldiers. Then he looked back at the email, at the words *leave your expectations*, and wondered what kind of fool volunteers to be disappointed by a different sky.

He hit reply and typed a single word: *Confirmed.*

In Astoria, Zadie did the same.

The dotted line had been found.

## Chapter 2: **Act I: The Great Exchange**

*The problem with swapping seats is you still bring your own eyes to the view.*

---

Zadie’s Uber driver was a woman named Darlene who drove a spotless minivan and spoke at length about the weather as if it were a mutual friend who’d recently betrayed them. “Never seen June this humid,” she clucked, adjusting the air conditioning with the reverence of a bomb technician. “Corn’ll be knee-high by the Fourth, though. That’s something.”

Zadie watched the landscape flatten and unspool outside the window. The sky was bigger here, which felt like a personal attack. In New York, the sky was a rumor you heard about from pigeons. Here it was a monologue. Cornfields stretched to the horizon, broken only by the occasional silo or barn that looked like it had been painted by someone who’d only read about colors in a book. The windmill from the Wikipedia page appeared on her left, looking improbably real, like a prop someone had forgotten to take down after a musical.

“First time in Elk Horn?” Darlene asked.

“First time in Iowa.”

“Well, you picked a good spot. We’re the Danish capital of America. Got a museum and everything.”

Zadie’s phone buzzed. Brian again. She watched the call ring through to voicemail, then texted: *Stop. I’m working.* A lie, but a necessary one. The truth—that she’d traded her Astoria sublet for a stranger’s life in corn country for reasons she still couldn’t articulate—sounded like something you’d tell a therapist, not an ex-boyfriend who still had a key to her apartment.

The minivan turned onto Main Street, which was exactly as wide as Zadie’s expectations were low. There was a post office, a hardware store with a sign that read *HARDWARE*, and a diner called The Danish Table that appeared to be the social and gravitational center of the town. A group of old men sat outside on a bench, conducting what looked like a very serious investigation into the properties of sunlight.

“Here we are,” Darlene announced, pulling up to a white two-story house with a wraparound porch and a flag that was not, as Zadie first thought, the Danish flag, but something with more colors and what might have been a windmill on it. “The Andersen place. Mette’s expecting you.”

Zadie climbed out, her single suitcase feeling like a joke in this landscape of silos and sky. The front door opened before she could knock, revealing a woman in her sixties with silver braids and an apron that had seen things.

“You must be Zadie,” she said, wiping her hands. “I’m Mette Andersen. You’re taller than you looked in your profile picture.”

“Filters,” Zadie muttered.

Mette’s laugh was a surprising thing, like a firecracker in a library. “Well, come in. I’ve got coffee on, and there’s a strudel that just came out of the oven. You look like you could use some feeding up.”

Inside, the house smelled of cinnamon and old wood and something Zadie couldn’t place until she saw the ceramic cow on the windowsill and realized it was the smell of *intentional* cows, not the accidental ones you got in certain Brooklyn neighborhoods. The living room was a shrine to Danish heritage: rosemaling on every wooden surface, a portrait of what Zadie assumed was a very important Viking, and at least seven different interpretations of the Danish flag.

“Your room’s upstairs,” Mette said, leading her to a staircase that creaked with the satisfaction of a job well done. “You’ll have the whole second floor to yourself. I’m a early riser, but I tiptoe. Mostly.”

The room was small and clean, with a slanted ceiling and a window that looked out over the backyard, which contained a vegetable garden, a clothesline, and a shed that had a weather vane shaped like a rooster. The bed had a quilt that looked hand-stitched. Zadie touched it gingerly, as if it might be a trap.

“Bathroom’s across the hall,” Mette continued. “Towels are in the cupboard. I left a map of the town on the dresser, though you can see most of it from the window. Supper’s at six. We’re having frikadeller.”

Zadie nodded as if she knew what that was. “Thank you. It’s—” She searched for the word. “Very cozy.”

Mette smiled, revealing a gap between her front teeth that made her look like she was about to tell a secret. “That’s what we do here. Cozy. You’ll get used to it, or you’ll go mad. Sometimes both.”

When Mette left, Zadie sat on the bed and listened to the silence. It was a different species than New York silence, which was always negotiating with the next siren or argument. This silence had tenure. It owned the place. She pulled out her phone—one bar, which felt like a personal insult—and saw Brian had left a voicemail. She deleted it without listening, then opened her email.

The program had sent her a list of her “exchange obligations.” She was to work at the local library three days a week, assist with the upcoming Tivoli Festival, and “immerse herself in the community.” The last one was underlined, which felt aggressive.

Her phone buzzed again. Not Brian this time, but a text from an unknown number: *Welcome to Elk Horn! This is your exchange partner, Emmett. Mette says you made it. Hope the trip was okay.*

Zadie stared at the message. This was the person whose life she’d stepped into. She typed: *Trip was fine. Your room is weirdly quiet.*

She deleted it. Typed: *Thanks. Your apartment is—*

Deleted that too. Finally settled on: *Made it. Thanks for the quilt.*

She hit send before she could overthink it further.

---

Emmett’s flight had been delayed in Chicago, which he took as a sign that even the universe needed time to process what he was doing. He spent three hours in O’Hare watching a man in a business suit have a very quiet breakdown over a bagel, and wondering if this was what civilization had come to.

The cab from LaGuardia to Astoria cost more than his first truck. The driver, who introduced himself only as “Viktor, like the author,” navigated the BQE with a religious fervor, muttering what Emmett assumed were prayers in a language that was definitely not English. The city rose up around them like a concrete tide, buildings stacked on buildings, signs screaming in languages Emmett had only seen on takeout menus. Everything moved faster than seemed advisable.

“First time in Queens?” Viktor asked, swerving around a cyclist who was either very brave or very stupid.

“First time in New York.”

Viktor whistled. “You are in for education. Astoria is good place. Greeks, Egyptians, young people with glasses. Very authentic.”

“Authentic what?”

“Authentic everything. Here, look.”

He pointed to a street where a man was selling what appeared to be entire lambs from a cart, while a woman in hijab argued with a vendor over the price of mangoes that glowed like sunset. A subway rattled overhead, shaking loose a fine dust of urban sediment. Emmett pressed his forehead to the window and tried to remember how to breathe.

The apartment was on 31st Street, above a Greek bakery that smelled of honey and yeast and something like destiny. The landlord, Mrs. Katsaros, was a tiny woman with the energy of a supernova who spoke in a mixture of English and Greek that somehow made perfect sense.

“You are the Iowa boy,” she announced, not waiting for confirmation. “Good. You are tall. The last one was short and broke the ceiling fan. Don’t break the ceiling fan. Come.”

The apartment was a studio that had been described in the exchange profile as “cozy” and “full of character,” which Emmett now understood were real estate terms for “you can touch both walls at once” and “the character is mold.” It was dominated by a Murphy bed that looked like it had a grudge, a kitchenette the size of a confession booth, and a window that faced a brick wall decorated with a mural of what might have been a pigeon or a very angry angel.

“The bathroom is here,” Mrs. Katsaros said, opening a door that revealed a shower stall so narrow it seemed designed for meditation rather than hygiene. “The hot water is moody. So am I. You need something, you call. Otherwise, you live your life, I live mine. The bakery opens at five. Don’t sleep through it, you’ll wake up thinking you’re in Greece.”

She left him with a set of keys that weighed as much as his conscience and a phone number written on the back of a baklava receipt.

Emmett stood in the center of the apartment and did a slow turn. From the window, he could hear the subway, a siren, someone shouting in Spanish about a dog. It was the opposite of silence. It was silence’s extroverted cousin who’d had too much coffee.

His phone buzzed. A text from the unknown number that was now saved as *Zadie (NYC)*: *Made it. Thanks for the quilt.*

He looked around the apartment, which contained no quilts but did have a polyester blanket that had probably witnessed the Nixon administration. He typed: *Glad you made it. The apartment is—* He searched for the word. *—loud.*

He hit send. A moment later, another text: *The town is the opposite. We might have miscalculated.*

Emmett smiled despite himself. He walked to the window and looked out at the mural. Up close, it was definitely a pigeon, wearing a crown. He took a picture and sent it to her. *This is watching me sleep.*

Her reply was immediate: *That’s Gerald. He’s famous. Don’t make eye contact.*

---

Zadie spent her first afternoon walking the perimeter of Elk Horn, which took forty-five minutes and included two stops to admire gardens and one incident where a golden retriever followed her for three blocks before getting distracted by a butterfly. The town was aggressively quaint. The post office had a flagpole with a flag that was actually at half-mast, which Zadie found unsettlingly sincere. The hardware store had a help wanted sign that looked hand-painted by someone who cared about kerning. The Danish Museum was closed for renovations, which felt like a metaphor.

She ended up at The Danish Table, where a waitress named Ingrid who was probably seventeen but had the bearing of a retirement planner brought her coffee and a slice of kringle without asking if she wanted it.

“You’re the girl from New York,” Ingrid said, not as a question.

“Is that a problem?”

“No. We just don’t get many new stories here. The last new person was a man from Des Moines who opened a vape shop. It closed in a month.”

Zadie sipped the coffee. It was surprisingly good. “What happened to him?”

“He moved to Des Moines. Said we were too exciting.” Ingrid smiled, revealing braces that had tiny rubber bands the color of the Danish flag. “You’ll do fine. You look like you know how to handle excitement.”

Zadie wasn’t sure if this was a compliment or a diagnosis.

---

Emmett’s first night in Astoria was a masterclass in urban acoustics. The subway ran until what felt like infinity. Someone played reggaeton at a volume that suggested either a party or a personal vendetta. At 2 a.m., a man on the street below had a loud and detailed conversation with a parking meter.

He lay on the Murphy bed, which had descended with the sigh of a falling tree, and stared at the ceiling. There was a water stain shaped like Iowa. He took a picture and sent it to Zadie.

Her reply came at what would have been 4 a.m. her time: *That’s the ghost of every Iowa farmer who tried to live here. You’re doomed.*

He laughed, the sound foreign in the small room. *What’s your ghost?*

*A pigeon named Gerald and a quilt that smells like cinnamon. I think I’ve been adopted.*

They texted back and forth until dawn, two strangers mapping their disorientation onto each other’s screens. When the bakery ovens fired up at five, Emmett was still awake. The smell of honey and yeast filled the apartment, and for the first time since he’d landed, something felt like it might be okay.

Down in Elk Horn, Zadie listened to Mette singing Danish folk songs while she made breakfast. The sun came up over the cornfields, turning everything gold and impossible. She pulled the quilt up to her chin and wondered what kind of fool volunteers to be disappointed by a different sky.

The answer, she was beginning to suspect, was the exact same kind of fool who might not be disappointed after all.

## Chapter 3: **The Night We Both Ran Away**

*“The corn grows whether you watch it or not. The city breathes whether you sleep or not. You might as well go for a walk.” — Mette Jorgensen, while ladling soup*

---

**Zadie ran out of patience at 8:47 p.m.** Central Time, which was precisely when Mette’s cousin Lars began playing the accordion.

The living room of Mette’s farmhouse had transformed into a miniature Danish folk festival. There were seven people, three of whom were named Jorgen, and all of whom seemed to know the words to a song about a sailor who fell in love with a mermaid but married a lighthouse instead. Zadie sat on the cinnamon-scented quilt—now functioning as a sofa cover—watching a woman knit what appeared to be a sweater for a sheepdog while simultaneously singing in perfect harmony.

Her phone buzzed. *How’s Viking corn country?*

Emmett. She typed back: *Currently being serenaded by an accordion and a collective trauma about maritime dating.*

*Better than the guy downstairs,* he replied. *He’s either assembling furniture or performing an exorcism.*

Zadie smiled, but it felt tight. The room was too warm. The candlelight too sincere. She was expected to stay until at least ten, when “the hygge peaks,” according to Mette, who had pressed a mug of gløgg into her hands and told her to drink it slowly because “the almonds sink to the bottom and tell secrets.”

Zadie had never been good at communal joy. In New York, loneliness was a performance art—you could be lonely in a crowd of five hundred and it felt appropriate, earned. Here, loneliness in a crowd of seven felt like a moral failing.

She slipped out the back door while Lars reached the mermaid-lighthouse climax, which involved a lot of high notes and hand gestures.

---

**Emmett ran out of his apartment at 9:12 p.m.** Eastern Time, which was exactly seventeen minutes after the man downstairs had begun what was either a very loud breakup or a very quiet murder.

The Murphy bed had swallowed his phone. He’d been trying to fish it out from between the wall and the mattress when the shouting started. Something about betrayal, something about a cat that wasn’t his, something about the rent being too damn high—which, Emmett had to agree with, having just transferred his entire savings to a landlord who communicated exclusively through Venmo requests and cryptic emojis.

He gave up on the phone, grabbed his wallet, and fled. The hallway smelled like someone was cooking something that involved fish and regret. The stairwell was a vertical echo chamber of other people’s lives: a baby crying, a sitcom laugh track, a woman speaking Russian into a Bluetooth headset with the intensity of a general commanding troops.

Outside, Astoria hit him like a wall of humid, living noise. The subway rattled overhead on its elevated tracks, spitting sparks that looked like dying stars. A guy on a bicycle was selling mangoes from a cooler strapped to his handlebars, shouting prices in three languages. The air smelled like diesel and jasmine and the particular funk of a city that never quite cooled down.

Emmett walked. He had no destination, which was a new sensation. In Iowa, you always had a destination—the field, the co-op, the diner where they knew your order. Here, destination seemed optional. Survival seemed optional. Everything was optional except motion.

His phone was back in the apartment, probably buzzing with texts from Zadie. He wondered if she was asleep. It was earlier there. Maybe she was at a bar. Maybe she was at a windmill. He realized he had no idea what people did for fun in Elk Horn after dark. Probably not wander the streets talking to parking meters. That felt like a him-specific problem.

---

**Zadie’s feet took her to the windmill.** It was the one from the Wikipedia page, the one that apparently made Elk Horn the largest Danish settlement in America. At night, it looked less like a tourist attraction and more like a monument to some forgotten agricultural god. The sails were still, silhouetted against a sky so thick with stars it looked fake, like a planetarium ceiling.

Her phone buzzed. *Where’d you escape to?*

She hadn’t told him she’d escaped. But of course he’d know. She typed: *The windmill. It’s judging me.*

*What’s it saying?*

*That I don’t know how to be still.*

She could almost hear him think about that. The reply took a minute: *The city’s not big on stillness either. I think I just walked three miles in a circle. Passed the same mango guy twice.*

*Are you happy?* she typed, then deleted it. Too direct. Too much. She sent instead: *What does your circle smell like?*

*Mango. Exhaust. Someone’s really good cologne. Yours?*

*Dust. Crickets. The ghost of a thousand Danish folk songs.*

A car rolled by, the first she’d seen in twenty minutes. It was Ingrid’s dad, she thought, the one who ran the feed store. He waved. She waved back. The car disappeared, and the silence rushed back in like water filling a footprint.

Zadie sat at the base of the windmill. The grass was damp with dew. In New York, grass was a theoretical concept, something that existed in parks you didn’t have time to visit. Here, it was a living carpet that would soak your jeans if you let it. She let it.

Her phone buzzed again, but it wasn’t Emmett. It was Brian. *Miss you, babe. This place is a mess without you.* She deleted it without reading the rest. The subtext was always the same: *Come back and fix things. Come back and be the person I need.*

She’d spent five years being the person everyone needed. The reliable one. The one who remembered birthdays and paid the ConEd bill on time and knew which bodega sold the good coffee at 2 a.m. She’d signed up for this swap because she was tired of being needed. But now, in a town where nobody needed her, she felt weightless in a way that was closer to panic than freedom.

She texted Emmett: *I think I broke up with my life.*

His reply was immediate: *Mine’s in the shop. Getting an oil change.*

She laughed, a real laugh that echoed off the windmill. A dog barked somewhere, and another answered. The crickets had a rhythm section now. It was a terrible song, but it was *hers*, at least for the moment.

---

**Emmett’s circle had taken him to the East River.** He hadn’t meant to go that far, but the city had a way of nudging you toward water. He stood at the edge of Astoria Park, watching the Manhattan skyline glitter across the river like a promise made by someone who couldn’t be trusted.

He thought about his dad, who’d probably be asleep on the couch by now, the TV still on, the dehumidifier humming its lonely song. He thought about the south field, which needed rotating. He thought about the email that had brought him here: *Leave your expectations.*

What he hadn’t expected was how loud loneliness could be in a city of millions. In Iowa, loneliness was quiet. It was the space between rows of corn, the hum of a single engine on a county road. Here, loneliness was a cacophony. It was being pressed against a hundred people on the subway and not making eye contact with a single one. It was the mango guy calling you “boss” but not knowing your name.

His phone was back in the apartment. He should go get it. Instead, he sat on a bench and watched a tugboat push a barge upriver. The water smelled like rust and salt and the kind of history they didn’t teach in Iowa schools.

A woman sat down next to him. She had a tote bag full of groceries and was talking on her phone in Greek. She didn’t acknowledge him, which felt both rude and correct. After a minute, she offered him a fig from a paper bag. He took it without question. It was perfect, sweet in a way that made his teeth ache.

“First time in Astoria?” she asked, still into her phone.

“Is it that obvious?”

“You have that look. Like you’re waiting for someone to tell you the rules.”

“There are rules?”

She finally looked at him, smiled. “Only one. Don’t block the sidewalk.”

She stood, walked away, became part of the city’s bloodstream again. Emmett ate the fig and thought about rules. In Iowa, the rules were written in the soil: plant after the last frost, rotate your crops, help your neighbor when the sky turns green. Here, the rules were whispered, negotiated, constantly revised.

He stood up. He needed his phone. He needed to know if Zadie was still at the windmill, if she was still laughing, if she still felt like she’d broken up with her life. He needed to tell her about the fig, about the woman, about how the city was teaching him things he hadn’t asked to learn.

---

**Zadie walked back through the cornfields.** Not the rows—she wasn’t a monster—but along the dirt road that bisected them. The corn was taller than she’d realized, a living wall that rustled with secrets. She half-expected a child with a knife to step out and offer her a religious pamphlet, but the only thing that emerged was a deer, which looked at her with profound disappointment before bounding away.

Her phone buzzed. *Coming back?* Emmett.

*Already am. You?*

*Got locked out. Mango guy remembered me. Gave me a free one. I think I’m a local now.*

She pictured him, this Iowa boy with his trucker hat and his careful manners, accepting a mango from a guy on a bicycle at midnight. The image was so perfect it hurt.

*Meet me at the windmill tomorrow?* she typed. *I’ll bring the ghosts.*

*Deal. I’ll bring the mango.*

She slipped back into Mette’s house through the kitchen door. The accordion had been retired. The candlelight had burned down to stubs. Someone had left a plate of butter cookies on the table, shaped like windmills. She took one and ate it standing over the sink, letting the crumbs fall into the basin. It tasted like belonging and exile at the same time.

Upstairs, Gerald the pigeon was asleep on the windowsill, a gray lump of feathers and indifference. She changed into the oversized t-shirt she’d stolen from Brian two years ago—the one that said *NEW YORK FUCKING CITY* in aggressive block letters—and crawled under the quilt.

Her phone buzzed one last time. *The water stain is gone,* Emmett wrote. *I think it was waiting for you to leave.*

She didn’t know what that meant, but she liked it. She typed back: *The crickets are still here. They’re not impressed.*

*Goodnight, Zadie.*

*Goodnight, Emmett.*

She lay in the dark, listening to the house settle, to the corn grow, to the ghosts of Danish folk songs hum themselves to sleep. She thought about running away, and how it felt less like escape and more like arrival.

In Astoria, Emmett climbed the stairs to his apartment, mango in hand. The door was still locked. He sat on the top step and ate it, juice running down his wrist, watching the sky lighten from black to bruise-blue. The city was waking up. The bakery ovens were firing. The mango guy was pedaling home.

He thought about running away, and how it felt less like leaving and more like leaning in.

The night they both ran away, they found themselves exactly where they were supposed to be: lost, and not minding it at all.

## Chapter 4: **The App That Appeared at Midnight**

*“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of—wait, no, that’s Gandhi. The best way to find yourself is to accidentally download a mysterious app at midnight and hope it’s not malware.”*

---

**Zadie** was awake when the clock struck twelve because the crickets had formed a union and were negotiating overtime pay directly outside her window. Or at least that’s what it felt like. The noise was orchestral, maddening, and weirdly specific—like each insect had been assigned a separate note and was determined to play it until someone filed a noise complaint.

She’d been in Elk Horn for six days. Six days of butter cookies, Danish folk songs, and a quilt that smelled so strongly of cinnamon she was starting to suspect it was actually made of cinnamon. Gerald the pigeon had accepted her presence with the grace of a deposed monarch, shitting on the windowsill exactly once per day as a reminder of who really owned the air rights.

Her phone buzzed. Not a text—Emmett was asleep, or should be. It was a notification from an app she didn’t remember installing.

**ELSEWHERE** had appeared on her home screen, icon a simple white circle with a tiny black dot off-center, like a pupil in an eye that wasn’t quite looking at you.

She tapped it.

The screen went black. Then, in lowercase letters: *welcome back, zadie.*

Back? She’d never been here before.

A map loaded—satellite view of Elk Horn, so detailed she could see the individual rows of corn in Mette’s field. A single pin pulsed at the windmill. Below it, text: **Your Anchor Point. Do Not Lose.**

She snorted. As if she could lose a windmill. It was the tallest thing for twenty miles.

Then the app asked: *what did you discover today?*

She typed: *Butter cookies are a legitimate food group.*

The app responded: **Accepted. +10 Local Knowledge. Continue.**

A new screen appeared: **Emmett’s Astoria (Live).** It was a blurred photo of a bodega window, neon sign buzzing, a cat sleeping on a stack of plantains. The caption read: *He is learning to see in the dark.*

Zadie’s stomach did something complicated. She zoomed in on the cat. It looked like it had seen things.

---

**Emmett** was awake because the man in 4B had decided 11:47 p.m. was the perfect time to practice what sounded like either tap-dancing or amateur carpentry. The ceiling thumped in a rhythm that suggested ambition without skill. He’d given up on sleep and was sitting on the fire escape, eating the second mango the mango guy had given him—*“On the house, Iowa. You’re a regular now.”*—when his phone lit up.

**ELSEWHERE** sat between his weather app and the one that tracked corn futures. He definitely hadn’t downloaded it.

He opened it.

*welcome back, emmett.*

The map that loaded showed Astoria in hyper-detail, down to the graffiti tag on the bakery door. A pin pulsed at his apartment building. **Your Anchor Point. Do Not Lose.**

Then: *what did you discover today?*

He thought about the mango guy, about the way the city changed after midnight—how the bodegas became small kingdoms, how the streets filled with people who had nowhere to be but couldn’t stand to be still. He typed: *Free mangoes taste better.*

**Accepted. +10 Local Knowledge. Continue.**

A new screen: **Zadie’s Elk Horn (Live).** A photo of a cornfield at dusk, the rows so straight they looked like lines of poetry. A shadow moved through them—someone walking. The caption: *She is learning to be still.*

Emmett zoomed in. It was Zadie, tiny and grainy, wearing what looked like a stolen t-shirt, her hair a dark smudge against the gold. He felt something tighten in his chest—not longing, exactly, but the ghost of it. The possibility.

---

The app gave them both the same instruction at 12:03 a.m.:

**Task: Leave your anchor point. Find something that doesn’t belong. Bring it back. Do not explain. Points awarded for mystery.**

Zadie stared at the screen. *Points?* She was a grown woman. She didn’t need points. But the app had a way of making disobedience feel like missing out, like skipping the best part of a story.

She pulled on Brian’s t-shirt—*NEW YORK FUCKING CITY* screaming across her chest—and slipped downstairs. Mette’s house was asleep, the accordion silent, the butter cookies covered with a dish towel. The front door creaked like it was telling secrets.

Outside, the air was a different substance than NYC air. It had weight, intention. The cornfields rustled with their own language. She walked toward the windmill, because where else would you go in Elk Horn at midnight? It loomed against the stars, a dark skeleton against all that light.

She found the thing that didn’t belong wedged in the windmill’s door: a single, pristine subway card. MetroCard, the real deal, not the new OMNY system. It had $2.75 on it, according to the faded stamp on the back. Someone had drawn a tiny windmill on it in ballpoint pen.

She took it. The app pinged: **+25 Mystery Points. Excellent work.**

---

Emmett’s task was harder. Astoria at midnight was a place that belonged to everyone and no one. Everything belonged. The broken umbrella in the gutter, the lone rollerblade hanging from a telephone wire, the mattress propped against a tree like a drunk friend—each had a story, a right to be there.

He walked past the bakery, where the ovens were finally cooling, past the bodega where the cat still slept on the plantains. He found himself at the waterfront, looking across the East River at Manhattan’s glow. The city was a jewelry box someone had forgotten to close.

That’s where he saw it: a single stalk of corn, growing from a crack in the concrete. It was only about two feet tall, its leaves frayed from exhaust and indifference, but it was undeniably corn. Someone had tied a tiny Danish flag to it, a scrap of red and white fabric no bigger than a postage stamp.

He took a picture. The app pinged: **+25 Mystery Points. You understand.**

He didn’t. But he pulled the flag free and put it in his pocket.

---

At 12:17 a.m., the app opened a chat window between them. No typing indicators. Just messages appearing as if the phone already knew what you wanted to say.

**Zadie:** I found your MetroCard.

**Emmett:** I found your corn.

**Zadie:** Did it have a flag?

**Emmett:** Did yours have a windmill?

**Zadie:** Yes.

**Emmett:** Then we’re even.

**Zadie:** We’re not even. We’re just both lost.

**Emmett:** The app says that’s the point.

**Zadie:** The app is a know-it-all.

**Emmett:** The app is probably right.

They stopped typing. The app filled the silence with a new feature: **Shared Inventory.** The MetroCard and the Danish flag appeared as icons, rotating slowly. Below them, text: *These items are now linked. Use them wisely.*

Zadie held the MetroCard up to the moonlight. It felt like a promise, or a threat. She slipped it into the pocket of her stolen t-shirt.

Emmett tied the Danish flag to his keychain. It fluttered like a tiny surrender.

---

The next morning, the app had a new message for each of them.

**Zadie:** *Your task: Teach someone something they didn’t know about where you came from. Bonus points if they don’t realize you’re teaching them.*

She found Ingrid at the front desk of the Danish Museum, which was really just two rooms and a gift shop that sold wooden shoes and nostalgia. Ingrid was polishing a display case that held a single butter churn.

“I have a question,” Zadie said, leaning on the counter. “What do you think New York smells like?”

Ingrid blinked. “Concrete? Desperation?”

“Cinnamon,” Zadie said. “And hot mangoes at midnight.”

Ingrid frowned. “Mangoes?”

“It’s a Queens thing. There’s this guy on a bike. He gives them to people who look lost.”

Ingrid looked at her like she’d started speaking in tongues. But later, when Zadie walked past the museum, she saw Ingrid googling “mango Queens midnight” on the ancient desktop computer. The app pinged: **+15 Subtlety Points.**

---

**Emmett:** *Your task: Learn something you didn’t know about where you are. Bonus points if you’re not trying.*

He wasn’t trying. He was just buying coffee from the bakery when the woman behind the counter—her name tag said *Stavroula*—asked, “You the Iowa boy?”

News traveled fast in neighborhoods where everyone stood in the same line every day.

“Yes, ma’am.”

She slid him a coffee and a pastry he hadn’t ordered. “You know why we have so many Greeks here?”

“No, ma’am.”

“Because Queens is the place you go when you’ve outgrown the place you came from. It’s not the destination. It’s the in-between. You understand?”

He thought about the corn stalk, about the mango guy, about the water stain that had disappeared. “I think I’m starting to.”

She nodded, satisfied. “Good. The in-between is where the good stuff happens.”

The app pinged: **+20 Wisdom Points. Stavroula approves.**

---

That night, at exactly midnight, the app opened a video call.

Zadie was in her room, the quilt pulled up to her chin. Emmett was on the fire escape, the city humming behind him. They both answered before the first ring finished.

“Hi,” she said.

“Hi,” he said.

They stared at each other, pixelated and real. The app had no filters, no effects. Just their faces, tired and awake in a way that felt like honesty.

“I think we’re supposed to meet,” she said.

“The windmill,” he agreed.

“I can’t. I’m here.”

“I’m there.”

The app typed for them: **You are both exactly where you need to be. The meeting is optional. The finding is not.**

Zadie held up the MetroCard. “I’m keeping this.”

Emmett held up the Danish flag. “Me too.”

“Are we hoarders?”

“Probably.”

“Are we crazy?”

“Definitely.”

The app closed the call. But not before Zadie saw the mango guy’s bicycle propped against Emmett’s building, and not before Emmett saw Gerald the pigeon land on Zadie’s windowsill, a gray ghost checking in on its tenant.

---

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent them both a final message for the night:

**You have accumulated enough points to unlock: The Reason.**

Zadie’s screen showed a single line: *You ran away to find the thing you couldn’t name.*

Emmett’s screen showed: *You stayed to name the thing you couldn’t find.*

They both tried to reply, but the app had already disappeared, leaving only the icons in their shared inventory spinning slowly, endlessly, like a windmill in a wind they couldn’t feel.

Zadie lay back on the pillow that smelled like cinnamon and cornfields. Emmett stayed on the fire escape, the city breathing around him. They were both lost, and they were both found, and they were both exactly where they were supposed to be: somewhere else.

The app had appeared at midnight. The app would appear again. But for now, they had the MetroCard and the Danish flag, the mango and the pigeon, the thing that didn’t belong and the place that did.

They had each other’s ghosts.

And that, for now, was enough.

## Chapter 5: **Sign Here in Triplicate**

*“The difference between a tourist and a resident is three signatures and a utility bill.” — Ancient proverb of both boroughs and boroughs*

Emmett’s first official act as a New Yorker was to sign a form stating he understood that the bakery ovens might, on occasion, produce enough heat to melt the paint off his studio door. The second was to initial a clause acknowledging that the mango vendor was not, in fact, a hallucination but a licensed mobile fruit distributor. The third was to provide two forms of ID and a handwritten essay on why he deserved a library card.

“You’re from *Iowa*,” the librarian said, examining his driver’s license as if it were a specimen from a distant planet. “Do they have libraries there?”

“Just the one,” Emmett said. “We share. It’s Tuesday.”

The librarian, a woman with silver hair and a name tag that read **DORIS – RETIRED BUT STILL JUDGING**, slid the card across the counter. “Welcome to Queens. We have six branches in a three-block radius. Don’t get cocky.”

Back in Elk Horn, Zadie was signing her own triplicate forms. They were mimeographed, smelled of purple ink and nostalgia, and requested her signature for: (1) a temporary position as a docent at the Danish Windmill, (2) a liability waiver in case she was impaled by a rogue wooden shoe during the wooden shoe demonstration, and (3) a promise that she would not, under any circumstances, refer to the museum’s prized 19th-century butter churn as “quaint.”

“You’ll do fine,” said the museum director, a man named Soren who looked like he’d been carved from the same oak as the windmill blades. “Just remember: the Danes who built this place didn’t cross an ocean to be called *quaint*.”

Zadie signed with a ballpoint pen that had a tiny Danish flag on the cap. The flag matched the one in her pocket, the one the app had given her. She wondered if signing in triplicate was a universal constant, like gravity or the way both cities smelled different after rain.

The app had been quiet for three days. Long enough for Zadie to learn the difference between *hygge* and *uhygge* (coziness and its sinister twin, un-coziness). Long enough for Emmett to discover that the water stain on his ceiling had returned, but now it looked like Denmark.

They texted, but less frantically. The initial vertigo of displacement had settled into a manageable dizziness. Emmett sent photos of his new library card. Zadie sent photos of the wooden shoes she’d been forbidden to mock. They were both building scaffolding.

---

**Inventory Update at 2:47 p.m.:**

**Emmett holds:**
- 1 MetroCard (unlimited, slightly bent)
- 1 Danish flag (fabric, pocket-sized)
- 1 library card (Queens Public Library, Astoria branch)
- 1 growing suspicion that the mango guy is following him

**Zadie holds:**
- 1 Danish flag (fabric, pocket-sized)
- 1 MetroCard (unlimited, pristine)
- 1 wooden shoe keychain (gift from Soren, possibly cursed)
- 1 pigeon named Gerald who has begun sleeping on her pillow

---

The app reappeared on a Tuesday, which was fitting, because Tuesday was the day the Iowans apparently shared their library. It manifested not with a notification but with a sound: the soft *thwip* of a paper fan opening. Both phones displayed the same message:

**Please sign the following in triplicate.  
Copy 1: For the place you left.  
Copy 2: For the place you are.  
Copy 3: For the place you’re becoming.**

Emmett was on the fire escape, eating a mango that had, true to his inventory suspicion, been handed to him by the mango guy, who had indeed been waiting outside his building. The man had a new bicycle. It had a basket. In the basket was a single mango and a copy of *The New Yorker* from 1987.

“For the archives,” the mango guy had said, then pedaled away humming what sounded like a Danish folk song.

Zadie was in the windmill’s upper loft, dusting the blades with a feather duster that was, according to Soren, “historically accurate and also completely useless.” Gerald rode on her shoulder, a warm weight of feathers and judgment.

The app presented them with a document. Not a digital form, but something that looked like it had been typed on a manual typewriter, then scanned by a machine that hated clarity.

**THE INTERIM RESIDENCE AGREEMENT**

*This agreement, made between Party A (The Runaway) and Party B (The Stayed), acknowledges that both parties are currently occupying spaces that do not belong to them in any legal sense, but belong to them entirely in every other sense.*

*Clause 1: You will not apologize for the ghosts you bring with you. They have baggage fees prepaid.*

*Clause 2: The mango is not a metaphor. The pigeon is not a symbol. They are simply a man on a bicycle and a bird on a windowsill, and that is enough.*

*Clause 3: You are allowed to love a place that doesn’t love you back yet. Cities and towns are slow to trust. Keep showing up.*

*Clause 4: The water stain and the wooden shoe have equal spiritual weight. Do not rank your hauntings.*

*Clause 5: Sign here. Then sign again. Then sign once more, just to be sure.*

At the bottom were three lines. Above each, a prompt:

**For the you that was:** ___________________

**For the you that is:** ___________________

**For the you that will be:** ___________________

Emmett stared at the screen. The city pulsed behind him, a living thing with sirens for a heartbeat. He thought about his father’s farm, the way the soil had a specific smell in April, like waking up. He thought about the Murphy bed, the water stain, the mango guy’s new bicycle basket. He thought about Zadie’s texts, the way she described the corn at night as “a dark ocean that whispers in Morse code.”

He typed:

**For the you that was:** *Emmett, who knew the bus schedule by heart*

**For the you that is:** *Emmett, who is learning the subway map is a living document*

**For the you that will be:** *Emmett, who might be both*

He pressed his thumb to the screen. The phone hummed, and the signature lines dissolved, replaced by a single spinning windmill icon.

In Elk Horn, Zadie held her phone with hands dusty from historical artifacts. Gerald pecked at the screen, helpfully adding a stray feather to the contract. She thought about her apartment in Astoria, the way the light hit the fire escape at 5 p.m., making it look like a ladder to somewhere. She thought about Mette’s kitchen, the accordion music, the way the Danish flag on her pen felt heavier than it should. She thought about Emmett’s texts, how he described the subway as “a river that runs both ways.”

She typed:

**For the you that was:** *Zadie, who could see three Starbucks from her window*

**For the you that is:** *Zadie, who can see infinity corn*

**For the you that will be:** *Zadie, who is bad at running away and good at arriving*

She pressed her thumb to the screen. The phone hummed. The windmill spun.

---

The app, satisfied, sent them both a receipt. It was a PDF, because even mystical forces need documentation.

**Thank you for your signatures. Your copies have been filed as follows:**

- **Copy 1 (For the place you left):** Has been placed in the archives of the Queens Public Library, Special Collections, under “Ephemeral Geography.”
- **Copy 2 (For the place you are):** Has been laminated and hung in the Danish Windmill’s gift shop, next to the wooden shoe keychains.
- **Copy 3 (For the place you’re becoming):** Will be delivered by hand. Please be patient. Our courier is a pigeon.

Gerald, as if on cue, cooed softly into Zadie’s ear.

Emmett looked up from his phone. The mango guy was back, his bicycle basket now containing only a single sheet of paper. He rode in lazy circles on the street below, not looking up.

“The courier is a man on a bicycle,” Emmett texted.

“The courier is a pigeon,” Zadie replied. “He’s looking at me like I owe him overtime.”

They both looked at their receipts again. At the bottom, in fine print:

**P.S. The triplicate is a lie. There is only one copy, and you are already holding it.**

---

The next morning, Emmett found a laminated copy of his signatures hanging in the library, exactly where the app had promised. Doris was dusting it with a cloth.

“New acquisition,” she said. “Some Iowa boy left his ghost.”

Emmett stared at his own handwriting, permanently preserved beside a first edition of *A Tree Grows in Brooklyn*.

“I’m that Iowa boy,” he said.

Doris didn’t look surprised. “Then you’re late. The mango guy’s been looking for you. Said you forgot your change.”

She handed him a quarter. It was warm, as if it had been held in someone’s hand for a very long time.

In Elk Horn, Zadie found her signatures in the windmill gift shop, laminated and hung between a postcard of the corn palace and a wooden shoe that had been made into a birdhouse. Soren was polishing it with beeswax.

“New addition,” he said. “Some city girl left her map.”

“I’m that city girl,” Zadie said.

Soren nodded. “Then you’re early. Gerald’s been waiting for you. Said you promised him a raise.”

The pigeon was on the counter, standing on a mimeographed form that read **REQUISITION FOR ADDITIONAL SUNFLOWER SEEDS**.

Zadie signed it. Once. Twice. Three times.

---

That night, the app sent one final message. No fanfare. Just a fact.

**The triplicate is complete. You have both signed your names to a place that doesn’t exist yet. It will be built from the following materials:**

**- 1 water stain, cartographic  
**- 1 wooden shoe, haunted  
**- 1 mango, delivered  
**- 1 pigeon, overworked  
**- 1 MetroCard, bent  
**- 1 Danish flag, stolen  
**- 2 signatures, forged from the selves you’re leaving behind**

**Construction begins at dawn. Please have your ghosts ready.**

Emmett sat on the fire escape, the quarter in his palm. He could hear the bakery ovens starting up. He could smell the yeast and the honey and the city’s particular perfume of possibility and garbage. He looked at the water stain on his ceiling. It had shifted again. Now it looked like a windmill.

In Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, Gerald on her pillow. She could hear Mette singing downstairs, something about the sea. She could smell the corn and the cinnamon and the particular perfume of belonging and exile. She looked at the wooden shoe keychain on her nightstand. In the candlelight, it looked like a tiny apartment building.

They both texted each other at the same time, the messages crossing in the digital ether like two strangers on a stairwell.

Emmett: *I think we’re building something.*

Zadie: *I think we’re being built.*

They didn’t need to see the reply to know what it said. The app had already told them: **The meeting is optional. The finding is not.**

The quarter in Emmett’s hand grew warm. The wooden shoe in Zadie’s hand grew light. They were both holding the same thing, which was nothing at all, which was everything.

In triplicate.

## Chapter 6: **Welcome to the Flyover State**

*The problem with ghosts is they always know the shortcuts.*

---

Emmett learned the mango guy’s name was Dimitri. He learned this because Dimitri’s bicycle collided with a produce crate on 31st Street and Emmett caught a cascade of nectarines before they could dent on the sidewalk. Dimitri repaid him with a mango and a piece of advice: “Your girl, she always stood here like she was waiting for a bus to somewhere else. You stand like the bus already left.”

It was 6:47 a.m. The city was a kiln of yeast and exhaust. Emmett ate the mango on the fire escape, watching the bakery’s exhaust fan turn the sky into a watercolor of butter and ash. The water stain on his ceiling had become a windmill overnight—four perfect blades, a tiny Danish flag snapping from its apex. He’d taken a photo and sent it to Zadie. She’d replied with a picture of the wooden shoe keychain, which now looked less like a clog and more like a brownstone with a stoop.

*Construction begins at dawn*, the app had said. Dawn had come and gone, and Emmett was still building something he couldn’t name.

In Elk Horn, Zadie was learning the difference between field corn and sweet corn. Mette made her shuck a dozen ears before breakfast, the silk clinging to her fingers like ghost hair. “The ghosts prefer sweet corn,” Mette said, as if this were a known fact. “They like to whisper through the husks.”

Zadie had stopped asking which ghosts. There were the Danish ghosts, the pioneer ghosts, the ghosts of teenagers who’d driven too fast down Highway 173. Elk Horn was a retirement community for the dearly departed, and they all had opinions about the newcomer.

Gerald the pigeon had opinions too. He’d moved from the windowsill to the pillow, and now he required a saucer of sunflower seeds before he’d vacate the bed so Zadie could make it. She’d signed his requisition form three times, and now there was a carbon copy in triplicate on Mette’s kitchen counter, stamped **APPROVED BY AVIAN RESOURCES**.

At 11:23 a.m., the app sent them both the same message:

**You have unlocked: The Tour Guide Quest.**
**Instructions: Show your ghost the thing they missed.**

Zadie read this while standing in the Danish Windmill, the real one, the 60-foot structure that had been shipped over in pieces in 1976. She was supposed to be sweeping the gift shop, but instead she was watching a spider spin a web between a postcard rack and a display of wooden shoes. The spider’s silk caught the sun and turned it into a fiber-optic map of a city that didn’t exist yet.

She texted Emmett: *What did I miss?*

He replied: *Everything. You treated it like a waiting room.*

She thought about that. The way she’d moved through Astoria, through all of Queens, through the entire city like it was a layover. The mango guy. The bakery. The fire escape. They’d been background noise to her real life, which was always happening somewhere else.

*Show me*, she typed.

---

Emmett’s tour began at the Museum of the Moving Image. He’d never been inside, but Zadie’s MetroCard had a faded sticker on the back that said **I ❤️ ASTORIA**, and he took it as a sign. The museum had a permanent exhibit on puppetry, and he stood in front of a case containing the actual Skeksis puppet from *The Dark Crystal*. It looked like a ghost that had been fired in a kiln and then given a job in middle management.

He took a photo. Sent it to Zadie. *You missed the puppets. They’re in charge.*

She replied: *Gerald says all birds are puppets that cut their strings.*

Emmett looked around. The museum was empty except for a security guard who was reading a Danish phrasebook. The guard looked up. “Er du den nye?” he asked. Are you the new one?

Emmett didn’t speak Danish, but he understood. “Jeg tror det,” he said. I think so.

The guard nodded and went back to his book. Emmett walked through the rest of the exhibit, taking photos of things that seemed like they belonged to Zadie’s ghost: the vintage video games she’d never played, the Jim Henson sketches she’d never seen, the gift shop keychains that looked like tiny wooden shoes.

At 3:14 p.m., the app sent him a location pin: **The Lemon Ice King of Corona**. He’d never had lemon ice. He’d never been to Corona. He went.

The line was twenty people deep, and everyone was speaking a language that wasn’t English. Emmett stood behind a man in a trucker hat that said **IOWA**, and felt the universe lean in to wink at him. When he got to the front, he ordered the smallest size. The woman behind the counter gave him a medium. “You look like you need it,” she said.

He ate it on the 7 train platform, the sour cold cracking through his molars. The water stain in his apartment had been right: this was a windmill. This whole city was a windmill, turning and turning, grinding experience into flour. You could make bread from it. You could feed yourself.

He sent Zadie a photo of the lemon ice. *Tastes like homesick.*

She replied: *Everything does.*

---

Zadie’s tour began at the Danish Immigrant Museum, which was technically cheating because she’d already been there, but she figured her ghost had missed the basement. She’d missed the basement. It smelled like mothballs and old paper, and there was a display case containing a single wooden shoe that had belonged to a woman who’d walked from Davenport to Elk Horn in 1871.

The shoe was carved with initials: **E.A.S.**

Zadie’s initials were Z.A.S. The app had called her signature forged from the self she was leaving behind. She wondered if E.A.S. had left a self behind in Denmark, and if that self was still walking, still carving initials into things.

She took a photo. Sent it to Emmett. *She walked 200 miles in this.*

He replied: *My great-great-grandmother walked 200 miles to get away from a man who carved initials into trees.*

*Did it work?*

*The trees are still there. So are the initials.*

Zadie put her hand on the glass case. The shoe hummed, or maybe that was the furnace. The app buzzed:

**You have found: The Original Ghost.**
**She is not impressed with your progress.**

Zadie laughed. The security guard—maybe the same one from the museum in Queens, maybe not—looked up from his Danish phrasebook. “Ghosts are terrible supervisors,” he said in perfect English.

“Tell me about it,” Zadie said.

---

At midnight, the app appeared with a video call. They both answered before the first ring. The connection was worse this time, pixelated and lagging, as if the signal had to travel through both time zones at once.

Emmett was on the fire escape. Behind him, the city was a constellation of windows, each one a life he wasn’t living. Zadie was in Mette’s kitchen, a candle burning on the table, Gerald pecking at a crumb.

“The app says I have to show you the thing you missed,” Emmett said.

“I think we’re showing each other,” Zadie said.

The app typed: **The Flyover State is not a place. It is a perspective. You are both in it.**

Emmett understood. He’d spent his whole life thinking New York was the destination. But to Zadie, it had been a layover. And Iowa—well, Iowa was the place planes flew over. The place people left. The place Emmett had stayed.

Zadie understood too. She’d treated Queens like it was temporary. But to Emmett, it was becoming real. And Elk Horn—she was becoming real there, which meant it was becoming real to her.

“I signed the pigeon form in triplicate,” she said.

“I got lemon ice from the King,” he said.

The app typed: **You have both accumulated enough points to unlock: The Reason, Part Two.**

Zadie’s screen showed: *You were waiting for permission to land.*

Emmett’s screen showed: *You were waiting for permission to leave.*

They looked at each other through the lag and the pixels. The mango guy’s bicycle was propped against Emmett’s building again. Gerald was on Zadie’s windowsill, a gray ghost checking his watch.

“I don’t want to go back,” Zadie said. It was the first time she’d said it out loud.

“I don’t think you have to,” Emmett said.

The app closed the call. But not before Zadie saw the water stain on Emmett’s ceiling, now clearly a windmill. Not before Emmett saw the wooden shoe on Zadie’s nightstand, now clearly a brownstone.

---

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent them both a final message:

**Construction update: The following materials have been delivered to the site:**

**- 1 lemon ice, medium, sour**
**- 1 wooden shoe, walked-in, 200 miles**
**- 1 pigeon, overworked but promoted**
**- 1 water stain, now operational**
**- 2 perspectives, adjusted**

**Please note: The Flyover State is now a destination. You are both cleared for landing.**

Emmett sat on the fire escape, the MetroCard warm in his palm. He could hear the bakery ovens cooling. He could smell the yeast settling. The city was no longer a waiting room. It was a place with a pigeon and a windmill and a mango guy who remembered your ghost.

In Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, Gerald on her pillow. She could hear Mette singing upstairs, something about the sea. The sea was a place you could leave and return to. The sea was always there, waiting.

She texted Emmett: *I think we’re home.*

He replied: *I think we always were.*

The app didn’t need to confirm it. The app had already done its job. But it sent one last message anyway, just for the record:

**The meeting is optional. The finding is not. Welcome to the Flyover State, population: you.**

Zadie ate a butter cookie shaped like a windmill. Emmett ate a mango, juice running down his wrist. They were both exactly where they were supposed to be: somewhere else, which was turning out to be the same place after all.

The ghosts were terrible supervisors. But they were excellent architects.

## Chapter 7: **This Is What $2,800 a Month Gets You?**

*"In New York, you don’t pay for square footage. You pay for the square footage of someone else’s memory."*

---

The lease was taped inside the freezer door, next to a photo of a dog that wasn’t Zadie’s and a magnet that read *I ❤️ BROOKLYN* in a font that had given up on itself. Emmett found it while looking for ice trays, which didn’t exist because the ice maker had died during the Bush administration. The lease said $2,800/month. Utilities not included. Pets okay if they were “emotional support or smaller than a breadbox.” Gerald, perched on the windowsill, was exactly breadbox-sized and emotionally supported no one.

Emmett did the math. That was 58 hours a month at the bakery, before taxes. More if you counted the mango guy’s habit of “forgetting” to pay for his lemon ice, which Emmett had started covering because the app had sent him a notification that read **Karma is a line item. Please adjust your budget accordingly.**

The apartment was a fourth-floor walk-up in a building that leaned like it was trying to whisper a secret to the bodega next door. The water stain on the ceiling had become a windmill so precise that Emmett could see the individual blades. It spun when the heat clanked on, which was whenever it felt like it. The floor tilted south. The windows opened inward. The shower had two temperatures: arctic betrayal and lava that remembered your sins.

And yet.

The mango guy had started leaving two mangoes. One for Emmett, one for “the ghost.” The ghost was Zadie, obviously, but the mango guy called her “the previous tenant who liked cinnamon.” He’d never met her, but he knew about the cinnamon because the pantry still smelled like it. Emmett had tried to explain that cinnamon didn’t linger like that, but the mango guy just tapped his temple and said, “Spices got memory, kid. Just like buildings.”

At 7:43 a.m., the app sent an inspection report:

**PROPERTY ASSESSMENT: 4B CHEEVER PLACE**
**- 1 water stain, operational (windmill, clockwise)**
**- 1 MetroCard, bent (emotional damage: moderate)**
**- 1 Danish flag, stolen (sentimental value: incalculable)**
**- 1 pigeon, overworked (promotion pending)**
**- 1 mango guy, aware (liability: absolute)**
**- 1 ghost, present (rent: paid in full)**

**CONCLUSION: You are not subletting. You are being haunted. Please update your renter’s insurance.**

Emmett texted Zadie: *Did you know your apartment costs more than a used Camry?*

She replied instantly, which meant it was 6:43 a.m. in Iowa and she was already awake. Gerald had trained her. *Did you know my childhood bedroom has a view of a silo that sings when the wind hits it just right?*

*Is that in the lease?*

*It’s in the blood.*

---

In Elk Horn, Zadie was learning the difference between a mortgage and a memory. Mette’s house—*their* house, the app kept insisting—had been paid off in 1987 when Mr. Jorgensen won a settlement from a faulty threshing machine. The only monthly payment was to the Danish Brotherhood of America, $22 for “continued cultural relevance.” Zadie had tried to pay it online. Mette had handed her a checkbook and a stamp with the Queen of Denmark’s face on it.

“You’re building credit,” Mette said, which made no sense but felt true.

The wooden shoe keychain had started glowing at night. Not dramatically—just a soft amber when Zadie pressed her thumb into the worn heel. The app called it “equity.” Zadie called it “witchcraft.” Gerald called it “time for seeds,” which he’d started demanding in triplicate. He’d brought her a form, again, this one titled **REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL PERCHING RIGHTS**. She’d signed it in three places, using three different pens, because the app had sent a follow-up: **Signatures must be materially distinct. Ghosts can spot a forgery.**

At the Museum of Danish America, Soren had given her a name tag that read *ZADIE, GHOST APPRENTICE*. She spent her days dusting model windmills and learning the proper way to say *hygge* (from the back of the throat, like you’re swallowing a warm thought). Tourists asked if she was “the New York girl.” She said yes. They took photos. She became a local character, which was what you called a ghost who hadn’t left yet.

The app sent her a parallel assessment:

**PROPERTY ASSESSMENT: 1426 VINDMØLLE LANE**
**- 1 wooden shoe, haunted (mileage: 200 miles)**
**- 1 pigeon, unionized (grievances: filed)**
**- 1 quilt, cinnamon-infused (emotional support: certified)**
**- 1 windmill, singing (tune: unidentifiable but catchy)**
**- 1 signature, forged from the self you’re leaving behind (valid: yes)**

**CONCLUSION: You are not a tenant. You are a monument. Please advise if you plan to host tours.**

---

At 9:17 p.m., the mango guy buzzed Emmett’s apartment. Not the building—*the apartment*. He’d figured out the intercom code, which was 4B4B4B, because Zadie had programmed it to be easy to remember. He held up a bag of lemon ice and a question.

“You gonna stay?”

Emmett was on the fire escape, watering a plant that had appeared that morning. It was a succulent in a coffee mug that said *World’s Okayest Tenant*. The app had left it with a note: **Please care for this ghost. It is drought-resistant but not emotion-resistant.**

“I don’t know,” Emmett said. “The rent’s a hostage situation.”

“The rent’s the same as it was yesterday,” the mango guy said. “You’re just looking at it now.”

He left the lemon ice on the windowsill. It came with a spoon that had *Zadie* engraved on it, which was impossible because it was plastic. Emmett ate it anyway. It tasted like sour nostalgia, which the app later defined as **a flavor profile common to subletters who have inherited someone else’s grocery list.**

Inside, the water stain was spinning faster. Emmett could hear it, a faint *whoosh* that synched with the traffic below. He held up the Danish flag—stolen from the Museum of Danish America, technically, though Soren had winked when he took it—and the stain slowed. The app pinged:

**Decorative coordination achieved. Feng shui: Danish modern.**

Emmett laughed. The sound was small in the apartment, which was also small. But the ghost was large. Zadie’s ghost had a laugh that echoed in the cinnamon scent. It had a way of organizing the spice rack by emotional significance. It had left behind a MetroCard that still worked, which was the real magic. Emmett had swiped it that morning. The turnstile had said *GO* but the screen had added, in smaller letters, *HOME?*

He’d gotten on the Q train. He’d ridden it to the end, to Coney Island, where the wind off the Atlantic smelled like corn and cinnamon. He’d stood on the boardwalk and watched a pigeon that might have been Gerald’s cousin argue with a seagull over a Danish flag napkin.

He texted Zadie: *I think your ghost is haunting my ghost.*

She replied: *Good. They can split the rent.*

---

At 10:30 p.m., the app initiated a video call. No warning. Just Zadie’s face, pale in the candlelight of Mette’s guest room, and Emmett’s face, orange from the streetlight that leaked through the windmill stain.

“The water stain looks like a brownstone now,” Zadie said.

“The wooden shoe looks like a subway map,” Emmett said.

They held up their objects. The MetroCard had a new scratch: a tiny windmill, carved into the magnetic strip. The wooden shoe had a new scuff: the letter Q.

“The mango guy asked if I was staying,” Emmett said.

“Mette asked if I was leaving,” Zadie said.

They stared at each other. The lag was gone. The pixels had cleared. They were looking through a window, not a screen.

“I don’t think we’re swapping back,” Zadie said.

“I don’t think we were supposed to,” Emmett said.

The app typed for them, but they spoke along:

**The meeting is optional.**

“The meeting is optional,” they said.

**The finding is not.**

“The finding is not,” they said.

The call ended. But the connection didn’t. Emmett could still smell the cornfields. Zadie could still hear the bakery ovens. They were both paying rent in a currency the other had left behind: memory, measured in square feet of ghost.

---

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. Not to Emmett. Not to Zadie. To the mango guy.

**DELIVERY CONFIRMATION: 1 lemon ice, medium, sour. Paid for by: The Previous Tenant.**
**NOTES: She says you can keep the spoon. She says the rent is worth it if you remember to water the succulent. She says the ghost is optional, but the mango is not.**

The mango guy looked at his phone, then up at the fourth-floor window where Emmett sat with a pigeon and a windmill and a flag that didn’t belong to him. He nodded, slow, like he was settling a debt.

In Elk Horn, Zadie blew out the candle. The wooden shoe glowed on the nightstand, a tiny brownstone in the dark. Gerald tucked his head under his wing and dreamed of subway perches and lemon ice.

They were both paying $2,800 a month. One in dollars. One in dust. Both were terrible deals. Both were worth it.

The windmill spun. The Q train rattled. The ghosts clocked in for their shift.

## Chapter 8: **The Culture Shock Survival Guide**

*Rule #1: The map is not the territory. The territory is also not the map. The map is currently being used as a coaster by a pigeon who has opinions about your life choices.*

---

Emmett learned on his third morning that New York City garbage trucks sang. Not metaphorically—though they did that too, in the key of existential dread—but actually sang, a particular descending wail that meant *your trash is now art, your art is now landfill, and you’re late for the thing you forgot to calendar*. He stood on the fire escape in boxer shorts and a Mette-knitted sweater, holding a bag of pigeon feed and his own inadequacy, while Gerald supervised from the windowsill with the expression of a landlord who’d seen this exact failure before.

The app had sent instructions at 5:47 a.m.: **Survival Guide Item #3: The city runs on a currency of inconvenience. Pay your dues by being slightly in the way at all times. Bonus points if you smell like yeast.**

Emmett smelled like yeast. Also like the mango guy’s cart, which had become his new coffee shop, his new therapist’s office, his new church. The mango guy—whose name was Luis, though the app still called him “the mango guy” in all official correspondence—had started leaving a small cup of lemon ice on the fire escape railing every morning, with a note written on MetroCard receipts: *She used to say it cut through the bullshit. You look like you got bullshit.*

He wasn’t wrong. Emmett’s bullshit included but was not limited to: a job he’d inherited that involved something called “synergy analytics” (Zadie’s old position, which he understood slightly less than he understood the pigeon’s tax forms), a bodega cat who had claimed his left shoe as a dependent, and a water stain on his ceiling that now looked so much like a windmill he was afraid to look up during Zoom calls in case his coworkers thought he’d moved to Holland.

The wooden shoe keychain sat on his nightstand. Every night, it grew lighter. Every morning, the MetroCard in his wallet grew heavier, as if absorbing the weight of whatever Zadie was shedding.

In Elk Horn, Zadie was shedding literal weight. The quilt Mette had made—hand-stitched, heavier than a mortgage—kept sliding off the bed. The wooden floors, which had seemed charmingly creaky on Day One, now spoke in complete sentences: *You’re walking wrong. You’re breathing wrong. You’re Iowa-ing wrong.* The app’s message to her that same morning had been characteristically unhelpful: **Survival Guide Item #3: The fields remember everything. Walk softly and carry a big ghost.**

Gerald—*her* Gerald, the one who’d flown 1,200 miles to perch on her windowsill and judge her Danish—had developed a habit of staring at the butter cookie windmills on the kitchen table until Zadie broke one in half and left it for him. He didn’t eat it. He just rearranged the crumbs into what looked suspiciously like a subway map. The Q line, specifically. Zadie recognized it from the scuff on her wooden shoe.

Mette had started teaching her to bake *kransekage*, which was less like baking and more like building a tower out of almond paste and hope. “In Denmark,” Mette said, rolling dough between palms that had seen seventy Iowa winters, “we make things that last by making things that crumble. You understand?”

Zadie did not understand. But she understood that when she spoke, her accent was shifting—her sharp vowels softening, her consonants picking up a lilt that made the locals nod at her like she’d finally learned the password. She understood that the cornfields outside her window were not silent. They whispered in a language of rust and root, and they were learning her name.

The app sent them both the same message at noon, which was 11 a.m. in Iowa because time, like everything else, was now negotiable:

**Survival Guide Item #4: You are not homesick. You are home-sick. The hyphen is a bridge. Walk across it.**

Emmett read this while standing in a Trader Joe’s line that stretched into next Tuesday. The woman behind him was buying twelve bouquets of eucalyptus and a single container of hummus. The man in front was arguing with the cashier about the philosophical implications of “fair trade” bananas. Emmett’s cart contained: one mango, one sourdough loaf, and a pigeon-feed mix he’d found in Zadie’s Amazon history labeled “FOR GERALD, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE.”

He was, he realized, impersonating a life. Badly.

Zadie read the message while trying to parallel park Mette’s tractor in the grocery store lot. The tractor didn’t have a reverse gear, or maybe it did and she just couldn’t find it behind the existential terror of being the woman who’d just driven a tractor to buy almond paste. A man in a John Deere hat gave her a thumbs-up. She gave him a finger-gun back. It was, she was learning, the Iowa equivalent of a firm handshake.

Later, they video-called. Not because they needed to. Because the app had started charging them for *not* calling, deducting invisible fees from their ghost-rent accounts.

“The water stain is definitely a windmill now,” Emmett said, angling his phone up. “Gerald keeps trying to roost on it.”

“The wooden shoe is definitely a brownstone,” Zadie said, holding hers to the camera. The Q scuff had deepened, now connecting to a scratch that looked like the 7 train. “Mette asked if I wanted to paint it. I think she thinks it’s a craft project.”

“Is it?”

“Everything’s a craft project here. They made a scarecrow that looks like the mayor. It’s more accurate than the mayor is.”

Emmett laughed. The sound echoed in his tiny apartment, bouncing off the water stain, the MetroCard, the ghost of Zadie’s ambition that still lived in the synergy analytics spreadsheets. “I got a care package from Mette. Butter cookies. They taste like… I don’t know. Like if nostalgia had a crunch.”

“I got one from Luis. Lemon ice. He said you’d understand.”

They stared at each other. The lag was back, but different now—less digital stutter, more purposeful pause, like the connection was taking a breath.

“I think the ghosts are building us a door,” Zadie said.

“I think the door is already here,” Emmett said. “We’re just on opposite sides of it.”

The app typed beneath their faces: **Survival Guide Item #5: A door is just a wall with commitment issues.**

That evening, Emmett discovered the true meaning of culture shock: it wasn’t the subway or the price of eggs or the fact that his neighbor practiced opera at 2 a.m. It was the bodega. Specifically, it was the bodega cat—now officially named “Dependent Shoe”—bringing him a dead mouse and dropping it at his feet with a look that said *welcome to the food chain, corn boy*.

He texted Zadie a picture. She replied with a photo of Gerald, who had caught a grasshopper and was attempting to teach it to tap dance on the windowsill.

**Survival Guide Item #6: Predators and prey are just roommates with different schedules.**

Zadie’s culture shock came at the town hall meeting, where she learned that Elk Horn had a committee for everything. A committee for the windmill. A committee for the butter cookie festival. A committee for committees. They asked her opinion on the new bike rack. She said, “Does anyone here even bike?” They nodded, solemn. She had given the correct answer. The correct answer was always a question that proved you were paying attention to the subtext.

Mette squeezed her hand under the table. “You’re doing fine, city mouse.”

“I’m a pigeon supervisor,” Zadie whispered back.

“Same thing.”

Back in the city, Emmett was learning that pigeon supervision involved paperwork. Gerald had left a form on his keyboard: **REQUISITION FOR ADDITIONAL FIRE ESCAPE REAL ESTATE (ATTACHED: FEATHERED DEPENDENT).** Emmett signed it. The printer, which had not worked since 2019, whirred to life and spat out a duplicate. He signed that too. The MetroCard in his wallet pulsed warm.

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. Not to Emmett. Not to Zadie. To the ghosts.

**ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE: The following materials have been successfully integrated:**

**- 1 city boy, softened**
**- 1 country girl, sharpened**
**- 1 pigeon, bilingual**
**- 1 water stain, zoned residential**
**- 1 wooden shoe, rent-controlled**
**- 2 perspectives, now load-bearing**

**Please note: The tenants have stopped asking for directions. They have started building. The meeting is optional. The finding is not. The rent is due in triplicate.**

Emmett sat on the fire escape, the MetroCard in his palm. The windmill stain spun slowly, casting a shadow that looked like a cornfield. In Elk Horn, Zadie lay under the quilt, the wooden shoe on her chest. The Q train rattled through its scuff mark, singing a song about garbage and possibility.

They were both exactly where they were supposed to be: lost, found, and terrible at supervising ghosts.

The ghosts, for their part, were excellent landlords. They’d just raised the rent.

## Chapter 9: **The First Video Call Disaster**

*"The blue circle spins. The connection is buffering. The self is loading."*

---

Zadie had learned to butter-coat her expectations. It was an Elk Horn skill: you didn’t ask for sunshine, you asked for *partly cloudy with a chance of enough light to find the shed keys*. So when the app pinged—**VIDEO CALL REQUEST: ACCEPT ARCHITECTURAL INSPECTION?**—she accepted the way she accepted the town’s butter cookie festival committee: with a mug of Mette’s chamomile tea and the quiet certainty that something would go slightly, charmingly wrong.

In Brooklyn, Emmett accepted the call while balancing a mango on his knee. The mango guy had started leaving fruit on the fire escape, unasked. Payment, maybe, for the ghost stories Emmett told him about cornfields that whispered. The mango was perfectly ripe. The call was perfectly timed. The pigeon on his shoulder—Gerald, who had flown in through the windmill stain—was perfectly asleep.

The screen resolved.

For a moment, everything was crisp. Zadie’s quilt was visible down to the elk-shaped stitching. Emmett’s fire escape rust showed every flake of orange. They could see each other’s pores, the hangnail on Zadie’s thumb, the lemon ice stain on Emmett’s t-shirt that hadn’t washed out.

Then the lag hit.

Not the usual half-second delay, the kind that made them speak in accidental rounds. This was *architectural* lag. Zadie’s words left her mouth and hung in the air above Emmett’s screen, literal subtitles made of dust motes. Emmett’s blink took three seconds to complete, and when his eyes reopened, they were Zadie’s eyes—green instead of brown, wide with a city’s perpetual alertness.

“The app’s glitching,” Zadie said. Her voice arrived in Emmett’s apartment a full minute later, distorted, as if it had traveled through the water stain on his ceiling. It dripped onto his forehead.

Emmett wiped it away. “I think we’re the glitch.”

On his screen, Zadie’s background was doing something it shouldn’t. The wooden shoe on her nightstand was casting a shadow that looked like the Manhattan skyline. The shadow moved. The shoe didn’t.

In Elk Horn, Zadie watched Emmett’s fire escape start to pixelate. Not in the digital sense—in the *actual* sense. The metal slats broke into tiny squares and began rearranging themselves into a pattern she recognized from the town hall’s linoleum floor. The pattern was voting on something. The pattern was a committee.

**CONNECTION UNSTABLE**, the app typed. **PLEASE HOLD WHILE WE RECALIBRATE YOUR PERSPECTIVES.**

The pigeon woke up. Gerald looked at the screen, then at Emmett, then at the mango. He made a sound like a dial-up modem.

“Gerald?” Emmett said.

The pigeon pecked the screen. Zadie felt it on her end—a sharp tap on her collarbone, right where a bird might perch on a subway railing. She looked down. There was a feather there, translucent, made of Wi-Fi signals.

“This is new,” she said.

Emmett’s voice arrived before his lips moved. “This is a disaster.”

The screen split—not into two images, but into two *times*. On the left, Zadie saw Emmett as he was: fire escape, mango, pigeon. On the right, she saw him as he *had been*: cornfields, a younger face, a blue pickup truck that still ran. The right-side Emmett was waving at her. The left-side Emmett was trying to close the app. Neither could see the other.

“Emmett,” Zadie said, careful now, the way you speak to a spooked animal. “Don’t move.”

“I’m not moving,” said two Emmetts, in stereo.

On his screen, Zadie was also splitting. Left-side Zadie was in Elk Horn, under the quilt. Right-side Zadie was in a Brooklyn apartment she recognized—*her* old apartment, the one she’d sublet, the one with the succulent she’d forgotten to water. Right-side Zadie was watering it. The succulent was dead. Right-side Zadie was crying, but the tears were made of static.

**USER ERROR DETECTED**, the app announced. **PLEASE REINSERT YOURSELF INTO THE CORRECT TIMELINE.**

“The app thinks we’re in the wrong bodies,” Emmett said. His voice was overlapping now, a chorus of past and present. “The app thinks we made a mistake.”

Zadie clutched the wooden shoe. The Q train scuff mark was hot. “We didn’t make a mistake. We made a *choice*.”

**CHOICES ARE NOT LOAD-BEARING**, the app replied. **PLEASE SUBMIT FORM 27-B: REQUEST FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCY IN SOMEONE ELSE’S FOOTPRINT.**

A form materialized on Emmett’s keyboard. It was made of dried mango skin. The questions were:

1. *Are you the person you are pretending to be? (If no, please attach proof of purchase.)*
2. *Does your ghost have a forwarding address?*
3. *In the event of a swap reversal, who keeps the memories?*

Gerald pecked at question three. The answer he typed was: *The pigeon decides.*

“This is ridiculous,” Emmett said. He tried to close the form. It stapled itself to his palm.

In Elk Horn, Zadie’s wooden shoe was vibrating. The brownstone shadow it cast was now three-dimensional, a tiny apartment building growing out of her nightstand like a mushroom. She could see into the windows. In one of them, a ghost was taking a shower. The ghost looked like her mother, who had never visited Elk Horn, who had never approved of corn.

“Emmett,” Zadie said, and now her voice was split too—one layer Brooklyn-brisk, one layer Iowa-slow. “I think we’re breaking the app.”

**THE APP IS NOT BROKEN**, the app corrected. **THE APP IS A MIRROR. YOU ARE BREAKING YOURSELVES.**

The call froze. Not the image—the *people*. Emmett’s hand, mid-reach for the mango, stuck in the air. Zadie’s blink, mid-blink, left her with one eye open, one eye closed. The world on each side of the screen began to leak.

A cornstalk grew through Emmett’s floorboards. It was polite. It knocked first.

A subway token rolled out from under Zadie’s quilt. It was rude. It swore at her in MTA announcements.

The mango guy knocked on Emmett’s window. He was holding a spoon. “She says you need to stir,” he said, pointing at the screen. “The connection’s separating.”

“Separating into what?” Emmett’s mouth moved, but the voice came from Zadie’s throat.

The mango guy shrugged. “Parts. You’re becoming ingredients.”

Mette appeared behind Zadie, holding a butter cookie shaped like a router. “The committee voted,” she said. “We’re not a committee anymore. We’re a construction crew.”

**CONSTRUCTION CREW ACTIVATED**, the app agreed. **PLEASE STAND BY WHILE WE DEMOLISH YOUR PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS.**

The screen went black. Not off—*black*, like fresh asphalt. Then words appeared, typed in real time, as if someone was writing them with a very careful finger:

*Once upon a time, a boy from Iowa and a girl from NYC exchanged places. This was not a mistake. This was a blueprint. But blueprints are not buildings. You have to build the building yourself. With your hands. And your ghosts. And your terrible, wonderful, load-bearing choices.*

The call reconnected.

Emmett was in Elk Horn. Zadie was in Brooklyn.

Just for a second. Just long enough to feel the air change—the humidity of corn versus the density of brick. Just long enough for Emmett to see the actual windmill, spinning, and for Zadie to see the actual Q train, rattling. Just long enough for them to panic.

Then they snapped back.

But they brought souvenirs.

Emmett’s fire escape now had a small plaque: **HISTORIC SITE: PIGEON SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE, EST. 2024.** It was written in Danish.

Zadie’s wooden shoe had a new smell: mango, cut with subway brake dust.

Gerald, the pigeon, was now bilingual. He cooed in iambic pentameter.

**DISASTER CONTAINED**, the app reported. **MOSTLY.**

The video call stabilized. Their faces were their own again. But the backgrounds had negotiated a treaty. Emmett’s corner of the screen showed a sliver of cornfield. Zadie’s showed a ghost of the fire escape.

“I think,” Emmett said, his voice finally synced to his mouth, “we need new rules.”

Zadie nodded. “Rule one: no more calls at midnight. The ghosts are management. They’re not supposed to be on the floor.”

“Rule two,” Emmett said. “We stop pretending we know what we’re doing.”

**RULE TWO APPROVED**, the app typed. **PLEASE NOTE: IGNORANCE IS NOW LOAD-BEARING.**

They sat in silence, breathing each other’s air through the screen. The panic had left a residue, like the film on a kettle that’s boiled dry. It tasted like lemon ice and butter cookies and the realization that they had built something without a permit.

“The mango guy says the rent’s going up,” Emmett said.

“Mette says the dust is due,” Zadie said.

They both looked at their objects. The MetroCard’s windmill scratch was deeper now, carved by something sharper than a key. The wooden shoe’s Q train scuff had multiplied. It was a whole line. It was the whole system.

**FINAL NOTE**, the app wrote. **THE DISASTER WAS NOT A BUG. IT WAS A LOAD TEST. YOU BOTH HELD. CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR GHOSTS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO PARTNERS.**

Gerald the pigeon, now a partner, pooped on Emmett’s keyboard. It was a contract. It was binding.

Zadie blew out her candle. The flame jumped to Emmett’s screen, burned there for a moment, then went out. They were both in the dark, but they could see each other perfectly.

“Goodnight, Emmett,” Zadie said.

“Goodnight, Zadie,” Emmett said.

The call ended. But the connection hummed, a low frequency, like a windmill spinning in a place with no wind. Like a train running on a track made of butter cookies. Like two people who had just learned that home is a structure you build with mismatched parts, and that sometimes the foundation is made of disaster.

In the morning, the mango guy would leave a spoon on Emmett’s windowsill. In Elk Horn, Mette would find a subway token in the butter cookie dough. The ghosts would hold a meeting. The meeting would be optional.

The finding would not.

---

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent a message to both of them. Not a group text. Two separate messages, identical in content but different in tone, the way a translation can change the meaning of a love letter.

**To: Emmett**
**Subject: Your Disaster Assessment**
**The girl from NYC is not a tenant. She is a structural requirement. Please stop trying to uninstall her. The cornfields miss you, but they understand. They have voted to grant you permanent residency in the place you are pretending to be. The mango is non-negotiable.**

**To: Zadie**
**Subject: Your Disaster Assessment**
**The boy from Iowa is not a placeholder. He is a load-bearing wall. Please stop trying to sublet him. The subway misses you, but it’s learning to whistle. It has voted to grant you permanent residency in the place you are pretending to leave. The wooden shoe is rent-controlled.**

They read the messages in their respective darks. They did not reply. They did not need to.

The disaster had been a test. They had passed by failing to hold themselves apart.

The ghosts, terrible supervisors, excellent architects, clocked out for the night. They left the blue circle spinning, just in case.

It spun. It spun. It found them, exactly where they were: home, which was somewhere else, which was turning out to be the same place after all, which was a disaster, which was perfect.

## Chapter 10: **Act II: Fish Out of Water**

*The problem with being a fish out of water is that eventually you learn to breathe air. The real trouble starts when you forget how to swim.*

---

Zadie’s first official duty as Pigeon Supervisor of Elk Horn was to adjudicate a dispute between a mourning dove and a pair of sparrows over a prime nesting location in the windmill’s upper gearbox. The sparrows had paperwork—twigs arranged in a formation that, if you squinted, looked like a signed lease. The dove had seniority and a single, devastating feather left on the sill as a gesture of grief.

“You’re supposed to be supervising pigeons,” Mette said, handing her a thermos of coffee that tasted like burnt toast and forgiveness.

“The pigeons unionized,” Zadie said. “They’re on break.”

This was true. Gerald had sent a delegate—a stout bird with a MetroCard clipped to its leg—who delivered a typed memo: **WE DEMAND SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND A FOUR-HOUR WORKDAY. THE FIRE ESCAPE IS NOT A MONARCHY. SINCERELY, LOCAL 401.** Zadie had stamped it APPROVED with the butter cookie festival committee’s seal, which she’d borrowed and immediately lost.

In New York, Emmett was learning that fire escape real estate was a cutthroat market. Gerald had sublet the eastern railing to a family of starlings who paid in bottle caps and insider information about which Chinese takeout place dumped the best leftover dumplings. The western railing was under negotiation with a squirrel who claimed squatters’ rights and had a lawyer—an actual lawyer, a guy from the fifth floor who’d passed the bar and then decided to represent urban wildlife pro bono.

“The squirrel says you owe him three pistachios and a guarantee of safe passage during the next Nor’easter,” Emmett read from a note pinned to his windowsill with a mango seed.

The mango guy, whose name was apparently just “Mango” according to the Sharpie on his apron, had started leaving things. A spoon. A lemon ice coupon. A tiny succulent in a yogurt cup with a Post-it: *She says you’re overwatering. She says the ghost likes it dry.*

Emmett didn’t know who “she” was. He suspected he did, but knowing and suspecting were different time zones.

Back in Elk Horn, Zadie was losing a battle with a butter cookie press that had been in commission since the Eisenhower administration. It required a specific prayer, a specific wrist angle, and what Mette called “the spirit of cooperative despair.” The cookies came out shaped like tiny windmills, but if you pressed too hard, they looked like the Chrysler Building having an existential crisis.

“The secret,” Mette said, “is to let the dough think it’s winning.”

Zadie’s phone buzzed. Not the app—the app only spoke at 12:04 a.m., like a bat signal for the emotionally unmoored. This was a text from a number she didn’t recognize: **(646) 555-0147**. It said: *Your pigeon is eating my everything bagel. He has excellent taste. Please advise.*

She looked out the bakery window. Gerald’s delegate was perched on the windowsill, beak dusted with poppy seeds, looking extremely pleased with itself.

Zadie typed back: *Give him the everything bagel. He’s on salary.*

The reply was instant: *He says salary is a construct. He wants equity.*

*Of course he does,* Zadie thought. *He’s from New York.*

She sent a final message: *Tell him the rent is due in triplicate. He’ll understand.*

In his apartment, Emmett’s phone buzzed. The same number—now showing up as **(712) 555-0198**—sent him a photo of a butter cookie shaped like a windmill with a Q train scuffed into its center. The caption read: *She says the ghosts voted. You’re now officially on the committee for the butter cookie festival. Meeting is optional. Finding is not.*

Emmett had never been on a committee. He’d never been on a *festival*. The most organized thing he’d done in Iowa was help his dad rotate the tires on the combine and that had ended with a lug nut lost to the cornfields, which his dad said was “a sacrifice to the harvest gods.”

He typed: *I don’t know how to make butter cookies.*

The reply: *Neither does she. That’s the point.*

The water stain on Emmett’s ceiling had developed neighborhoods. The brownstone had a stoop now. The windmill had a tiny, defiant flag. He’d started talking to it, which was fine, because in New York talking to your ceiling was only the seventh-weirdest thing your neighbors were doing at any given moment. Mrs. Chen from 3B was learning the bagpipes. Someone on the sixth floor was breeding silkworms. The guy directly below Emmett had a podcast about the secret lives of parking meters.

Emmett’s podcast was about pigeons. He’d recorded three episodes: **Episode 1: Gerald and the Great MetroCard Heist**, **Episode 2: Squirrel Law: A Primer**, and **Episode 3: The Mango Guy Is Not a Metaphor (Or Is He?)**. He had zero listeners but seventeen ghost subscribers, which he knew because the app had sent him a notification: **YOUR PODCAST HAS BEEN ARCHIVED BY THE TENANTS. THEY FIND YOUR VOICE SOOTHING. THEY HAVE VOTED TO RENEW YOUR LEASE IN PERPETUITY.**

He didn’t know what that meant. He suspected it meant he was never leaving.

In Elk Horn, Zadie had been voluntold to join the committee for the windmill. This involved meetings at the library basement where the coffee was always Folgers and the agenda was always existential. They discussed the windmill’s tilt (three degrees off, “character-building”), its paint (faded, “authentic”), and its ghost (present, “rude”).

“Does every building have a ghost?” Zadie asked.

“Not every building,” said the chair, a man named Lars who wore a seed corn cap indoors. “But every structure has a memory. Some are just louder than others.”

Zadie thought of her brownstone in Brooklyn, the way the stairs creaked in a pattern that sounded like her mother’s footsteps. The way the radiator hissed her name. The way the mango guy had looked at her like she was a story he was trying to finish.

“The windmill’s memory,” Lars said, “is that it used to be somewhere else. Whole thing was shipped over from Denmark in 1976. Took six months to reassemble. Some parts are still missing. We think they’re in the ghost.”

Zadie looked at the wooden shoe on the table. It had a new scuff: a tiny, perfect mango.

---

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent two messages. Not to Emmett and Zadie. To the objects.

**To: MetroCard**  
*The wooden shoe has been promoted to co-chair of the butter cookie festival. It requests your attendance. Please bring seeds.*

**To: Wooden Shoe**  
*The MetroCard has been subpoenaed by Squirrel Law. It requests your testimony. Please bring crumbs.*

Emmett found his MetroCard vibrating in his wallet. The tiny windmill carved into the magnetic strip was spinning. He held it up to the light. Through the scratch, he could see Zadie’s kitchen in Elk Horn, the butter cookie press, the ghost of a flour fight.

Zadie’s wooden shoe was glowing on the nightstand. The Q train scuff had become a portal, a tiny window into Emmett’s fire escape, where Gerald and the starlings were holding what looked like a board meeting. One starling had a PowerPoint. It was just twigs, but the twigs were *very* organized.

They called each other without dialing.

“The app is talking to my MetroCard,” Emmett said.

“The app is talking to my shoe,” Zadie said.

They paused. The lag was back, but it was different now. Not a delay. A depth.

“I think we’re the app now,” Zadie said.

“I think we always were,” Emmett said.

---

The next morning, Zadie discovered a subway token in the butter cookie dough. It was old, the kind you couldn’t use anymore, but when she held it, she heard the Q train rattling through the dough, singing about garbage and possibility. She pressed it into a cookie. The cookie came out perfect.

Emmett found a windmill carved into his windowsill, right where the mango guy left the spoon. It was small, precise, the work of a pocketknife and a patient hand. When he traced it with his finger, he smelled cornfields and coffee that tasted like burnt toast.

The mango guy looked up from his cart and nodded. “She’s learning,” he said.

“Learning what?” Emmett asked.

“How to build with butter,” Mango said. “How to live in a structure made of missing parts.”

In Elk Horn, Mette looked at the subway token cookie and said, “He’s learning.”

“Learning what?” Zadie asked.

“How to supervise a ghost,” Mette said. “How to pay rent in a currency that doesn’t exist yet.”

---

The fish-out-of-water feeling didn’t go away. It deepened. Zadie learned to breathe the air of a place where everyone knew your business and that was a kind of love. Emmett learned to swim in a sea of strangers and that was a kind of freedom.

They were both still terrible at supervising ghosts. The ghosts, for their part, had given up on supervision and moved on to architecture. They were building a bridge between a windmill and a brownstone, between a MetroCard and a wooden shoe, between a girl who thought she needed to leave and a boy who thought he needed to stay.

The bridge was made of butter cookies and mango spoons, of pigeon feathers and squirrel law, of water stains and flour ghosts.

It was a terrible design. It was perfect.

At 12:04 a.m., the app sent its final message of the night. To both of them, but also to itself.

**ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE: The fish have learned to walk. The birds have learned to swim. The tenants have stopped paying rent in memory. They have started paying it in momentum. The meeting is optional. The finding is not. The structure is load-bearing. The disaster is complete.**

Emmett sat on his fire escape, holding a butter cookie that tasted like the Q train. Zadie sat in the windmill’s shadow, holding a MetroCard that spun like a tiny, defiant flag.

They were both exactly where they were supposed to be: out of water, out of air, building a third thing that was neither and both.

The ghosts clocked in for their shift. They were excellent architects. They’d just approved the blueprints.

The blueprints were blank. The tenants would fill them in.
