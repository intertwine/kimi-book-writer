he confesses he was the rookie first responder to a cold case at that same coaster.\n\n15. **Maggie Holt** \u2014 Vera finally admits she witnessed Maggie Holt\u2019s murder twenty years ago on the Timber Terror but was too terrified to testify.\n\n16. **The Cold Case** \u2014 Declan pulls the Maggie Holt file and finds the original detective\u2019s notes eerily similar to the language in Vera\u2019s novels.\n\n17. **The Editor** \u2014 Vera receives an email from \u201cThe Editor\u201d containing a manuscript page describing the first murder with details only the killer could know.\n\n18. **Accelerated Timeline** \u2014 The fourth murder occurs a day early, breaking the pattern;

      "content": "## Chapter 1: **The Timber Terror**\n\n*\"The difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense. Reality just has to make it to the bottom of the hill.\"*\n\nThe Ferris wheel groaned against the Atlantic wind, its rusted spokes catching the last light of day like the ribs of some beached mechanical whale. Diana Vance watched it from the parking lot, her laptop bag digging into her shoulder, and wondered which would collapse first\u2014the wheel or her career. Both seemed equally likely.\n\nShe'd come to Maine's coastal fairgrounds on a fool's errand, chasing a rumor about a carnie who'd witnessed a murder twenty years ago. The kind of detail that might lend her failing manuscript the authenticity her agent kept demanding. Instead, she'd found a ghost town of shuttered booths and a rollercoaster that looked like it had been assembled from driftwood and regret.\n\n\"Timber Terror,\" the sign read, hand-painted in flaking red letters. *Subtle*, Diana thought. She specialized in subtlety the way a sledgehammer specialized in surgery.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Another text from her ex-husband, the literary critic, who'd taken to reviewing her work in public forums with the gleeful precision of a man performing an autopsy on their marriage. *\"Your dialogue rings false because you've forgotten what honest conversation sounds like.\"* She deleted it without replying. Honest conversation was overrated. That's why she wrote crime fiction\u2014because in her world, people said what they meant with guns, not words.\n\nA teenage attendant with nicotine-stained fingers took her ticket. \"First car's best view,\" he mumbled, not looking up from his phone.\n\n\"I'm not here for the view.\"\n\n\"Nobody is, lady.\"\n\nThe queue was short\u2014just a handful of locals and a family of tourists who'd made a wrong turn somewhere between Portland and common sense. Diana's writer's mind catalogued them automatically: the mother clutching her purse like it contained state secrets, the father with the defensive wounds of a man who'd learned to keep his hands up early, the daughter who watched everything with the flat affect of a crime scene witness. Diana had written them all before. They'd all died badly in chapter seven.\n\nThen she noticed the man.\n\nHe stood alone, third car back, wearing a tweed jacket that had seen better decades and shoes that were definitely not fairground-appropriate. He was studying the coaster's wooden framework with the intensity of a coroner examining a body. Something about the set of his shoulders, the way his eyes tracked the bolts and crossbeams\u2014he didn't belong here any more than she did.\n\n*Detective*, her mind supplied. *Retired. Divorced. Drinks scotch from coffee mugs. Has a daughter who doesn't call.*\n\nThe line moved. The family piled into the first car, squealing with manufactured joy. The attendant gestured Diana toward the second. She hesitated, then felt the pressure of the man behind her\u2014too close, deliberate. She stepped up into the car, and he followed.\n\n\"Mind if I join you?\" His voice was gravel and gunpowder, a voice that had read too many people their rights.\n\n\"It's a free country,\" she said, \"or so they keep telling me.\"\n\nHe settled beside her, his weight making the car tilt. The safety bar came down with a metallic shriek. Up close, she could smell old leather and older coffee, could see the ink stains on his fingers that no amount of scrubbing would remove. He was younger than she'd thought\u2014mid-forties, maybe\u2014but carried himself like a man who'd aged in dog years.\n\nThe coaster jerked forward.\n\n\"You write books,\" he said. Not a question.\n\nDiana's stomach dropped before they'd even reached the lift hill. \"Everybody writes books these days. It's cheaper than therapy.\"\n\n\"Not like yours.\" He turned to face her, and she saw it in his eyes\u2014the thing she recognized from every interview with every cop who'd ever resented her existence. \"You write about us like you know us.\"\n\nThe chain lift engaged, clicking them upward. The fairgrounds fell away, revealing the bruised sky over the Atlantic, the parking lot where her rental car sat like a guilty secret. The wind carried the smell of salt and fried dough.\n\n\"I research,\" she said. \"I interview. I do my homework.\"\n\n\"You make things up.\"\n\n\"That's the job description.\"\n\nHe laughed, a sound like a file on bone. \"Job description. Right.\" He pointed at the coaster's frame as they climbed. \"See that? Pressure-treated pine, reinforced with steel plates. Built in '87. They've been patching it for thirty-six years. Every bolt, every brace, is a lie they told the state inspector.\"\n\nDiana followed his finger. She saw the fresh welds, the newer wood among the old, the way the structure leaned slightly seaward as if trying to escape.\n\n\"Your books are like this coaster,\" he continued. \"Pretty from a distance. Up close, it's all patchwork. All shortcuts. You make detectives look like poets with badges, turning over lyrical one-liners while they contemplate the darkness in their souls.\"\n\n\"And how should I write them?\"\n\n\"Like men who've seen kids shot over sneakers. Like women who throw up in the bushes after their first floaters. Like people who make mistakes and carry them like tumors.\"\n\nThey crested the lift hill. For a moment, there was only the view\u2014the ocean eating the sun, the coast a jagged line of regret. Then gravity took over.\n\nThe drop was pure freefall, the kind that made your organs question their life choices. Diana's breath caught, her hands white-knuckled on the bar. Beside her, the man raised his arms like a kid on his first ride. The wind tore at his jacket, revealing a shoulder holster, empty but molded to the shape of a weapon long carried.\n\nThe first turn slammed them left. The coaster's timbers screamed. Diana's mind, trained to find narrative in chaos, saw the story: a structure held together by inertia and denial, each passenger complicit in the illusion of safety. Just like her books. Just like her life.\n\n\"You're Detective Calhoun,\" she said, the name coming to her in a flash of recognition. The cop who'd called her publisher last month, left a voicemail she'd been advised not to return. The one whose partner had died in a shootout she'd fictionalized before the bodies were cold.\n\nHe didn't look surprised she'd placed him. \"You used my case.\"\n\n\"I used a case. The details were public record.\"\n\n\"The pain wasn't.\"\n\nThe coaster hit a series of bunny hills, each one a punch to the spine. Around them, the few other riders whooped and hollered. Diana and Calhoun might have been in a separate car entirely, sealed in a bubble of mutual antagonism.\n\n\"Your partner,\" she said, because someone had to. \"Delgado. You think I exploited him.\"\n\n\"I think you sold his death for a hardcover advance and a blurb from Lee Child.\"\n\nThe accusation landed harder than the coaster's next drop. Diana's agent had called the timing \"fortuitous.\" Her editor had said the authenticity would \"elevate the narrative.\" Neither had mentioned the widow, the kids, the real man bleeding out in a bodega while Diana typed up a fictional version in her Brooklyn apartment, drinking wine that cost more than his weekly grocery bill.\n\n\"I donate,\" she said, the words weak even to her. \"Royalties. To the fund.\"\n\n\"Seventeen thousand dollars,\" Calhoun said. \"I checked. That's what his life was worth to you. Seventeen K and a starred review in the *Times*.\"\n\nThe coaster dove into a dark tunnel, a moment of pure blackness. In it, Diana felt the full weight of her profession\u2014the way she mined other people's tragedies for plot points, the way she turned grief into genre. She'd always told herself she was honoring the dead. But in the dark, with this man beside her, the fiction felt thin.\n\nLight hit them like a confession. The final turn approached, a brutal 180-degree sweep that threw them against each other, shoulder to shoulder. She could feel the heat of him, the coiled anger.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked.\n\n\"Truth.\"\n\n\"I write fiction.\"\n\n\"Then write better fiction.\" He turned to her as the coaster began its final ascent, the big finish. \"Write about the way the blood never really washes out from under your fingernails. Write about the dreams. Write about the time you almost shot a kid because he reached for his wallet too fast, and how you went home and stared at your own kid's picture and wondered if karma was real.\"\n\nThe final drop loomed. Sixty feet, straight down, into a brake run that sounded like bones breaking.\n\n\"How do you know I haven't?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because you still sleep at night.\"\n\nThe coaster plunged. Diana's stomach stayed at the top. The world became a blur of wood and sky and Calhoun's voice in her ear, saying words that would haunt her manuscripts for years: *\"The terror isn't the fall. It's the knowing you chose to climb.\"*\n\nThey hit the brakes. The car shuddered, slowed, crawled into the station. The family in front was already giggling, already planning their next ride. The attendant looked bored. The world had not changed.\n\nBut Diana had.\n\nShe fumbled with the safety bar, her fingers suddenly clumsy. Calhoun sat motionless beside her, watching her with those cop's eyes that had seen everything and believed nothing.\n\n\"There's a case,\" he said, his voice now barely a whisper. \"A real one. Up the coast. A body in a lobster trap, another in a burned-out lighthouse. The locals are calling it a serial. They're wrong.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\"\n\n\"Because you're going to write about it.\" He stood, stepped out of the car. \"But this time, you're going to get it right. And I'm going to make sure of it.\"\n\nHe walked away, his tweed jacket disappearing into the gathering dark. Diana sat in the empty coaster car, the fairground lights flickering to life around her, and felt the first true terror she'd experienced in years.\n\nIt wasn't the height. It wasn't the speed.\n\nIt was the realization that someone had just handed her the story she'd been pretending to write her entire career\u2014and that getting it wrong might cost more than her advance.\n\nIt might cost her soul.\n\nThe attendant cleared his throat. \"You getting out, lady? Or you want to go again?\"\n\nDiana rose on unsteady legs. The night air tasted of salt and storm. Somewhere in the dark, Detective Calhoun was walking back to his real life, leaving her with a choice: keep writing pretty lies, or finally learn what truth looked like, even if it broke her.\n\nShe pulled out her phone, opened a fresh document. The cursor blinked, waiting.\n\nHer fingers hovered over the keys.\n\nThen she typed: *The body in the lobster trap had no hands.*\n\nIt was a start."

      "content": "## Chapter 2: **Act I: The Opening Hook**\n\n*The truth doesn't set you free. It weighs you down until you either learn to swim or drown in it.*\n\nDiana's motel room smelled of mildew and the ghost of a thousand cigarettes. The Sea Breeze Inn\u2014misnamed, since there was nothing breezy about it and the only sea was a half-mile slog through mosquito-thick pines. She'd chosen it deliberately: cheap, anonymous, far enough from the tourist traps that no one would ask questions. The kind of place where a woman could sit in her underwear at two a.m., typing about dead bodies while the ice machine groaned through the wall.\n\nHer laptop screen cast the only light. Outside, the wind had teeth.\n\n*The body in the lobster trap had no hands.*\n\nShe'd written that line twelve times, each iteration more false than the last. The cursor blinked, accusing. She'd tried adding details: *The rope had cut into the wrists where the hands should have been. The lobsters had been feeding for days.* But it still read like something she'd cribbed from a forensic pathology textbook. It had the rhythm of truth but none of the weight.\n\nThe rollercoaster had been three days ago. Calhoun hadn't called. She'd half-convinced herself he'd been a hallucination, some trick of altitude and adrenaline. But the business card on the nightstand was real enough: *Detective First Grade Samuel Calhoun, Maine State Police.* The number was a Rockland exchange, the paper cheap stock that felt like it might dissolve in the damp air.\n\nShe picked it up, turned it over. On the back, in a cramped, left-leaning scrawl: *Sunset Acres Lobster Pound. 6 a.m. Don't wear perfume.*\n\nThat was it. No invitation, no explanation. Just a commandment from a man who'd seen everything and believed nothing.\n\nThe clock read 4:47. She hadn't slept.\n\n---\n\nSunset Acres was a weathered shack on a weathered pier, its pilings green with age and guano. The sky was the color of old tin, the kind of dawn that promised rain but never delivered, just hung there heavy and waiting. Diana's rental car crunched over crushed shells, the sound too loud in the stillness. She'd dressed in layers, wool and canvas, everything she owned that might pass for local. She'd left the perfume in Boston, along with her better judgment.\n\nA man in orange oilskins hosed down the deck, the water running pink with fish blood. He didn't look up when she approached.\n\n\"Calhoun around?\"\n\nThe man pointed with his chin toward the far end of the pier, where a figure stood at the rail, smoking. The wind caught the smoke and tore it apart.\n\nCalhoun looked smaller without the rollercoaster scaffolding behind him. Older. The tweed jacket was gone, replaced by a canvas coat that had seen harder winters than Diana had. He didn't turn when she joined him.\n\n\"You came,\" he said.\n\n\"You didn't give me much choice.\"\n\n\"There's always a choice.\" He flicked his cigarette into the water. \"That's what makes the bad ones so interesting.\"\n\nBelow, the harbor was a sheet of hammered lead. Buoys bobbed, their bells clanging a mournful rhythm. In the distance, a lighthouse stood on a rocky spine\u2014white against gray, its lantern dark. Diana felt the familiar twitch in her fingers, the urge to describe it, to capture it in language. She forced her hands into her pockets.\n\n\"The lobster trap,\" she said. \"Where did they find it?\"\n\n\"Half-mile off Owl's Head. Commercial hauler brought it in last Tuesday. Thought he'd hit the jackpot\u2014full pot, heavy. Turned out the weight was a torso.\"\n\n\"And the hands?\"\n\n\"Gone. Not chewed off, not torn. Removed. Clean. Medical precision.\" He finally looked at her, his eyes the color of the water. \"That's the part that doesn't fit. Rest of it's messy. Impulsive. The lighthouse fire, that was amateur hour. Kerosene and a match. But the hands... that took skill. Patience.\"\n\nDiana's breath caught. \"You said locals think it's a serial.\"\n\n\"They're wrong because it's not serial. It's something else.\" He pulled a folded photograph from his coat. \"This is why you're here.\"\n\nThe image showed a woman's face, or what remained of it. The left side was pristine, almost peaceful. The right was a map of burns, the skin melted and reformed in grotesque topography. One eye stared directly at the camera, blue and accusatory. The other was a ruined hole.\n\n\"Third victim,\" Calhoun said. \"Found her in a vacation rental up in Camden. They'd left her in the bathtub. Water was cold when the cleaning lady arrived.\"\n\nDiana's stomach turned. This wasn't the sanitized violence of her novels, where bodies were puzzles and death was a plot device. This was intimate. Deliberate. Angry.\n\n\"Why show me this?\"\n\n\"Because you write about monsters.\" He said it flatly, no judgment. \"And I need to know what kind of monster this is.\"\n\n\"I'm not a profiler.\"\n\n\"No. You're a liar.\" He held up a hand before she could protest. \"Good fiction, it's just lying with style. You make up people, give them motives that make sense. Real people don't make sense. They do things that contradict everything they claim to believe. They love what they destroy. They save what they should kill.\" He tapped the photo. \"This guy? He's telling a story. I need to know how it ends before he writes another chapter.\"\n\nThe wind shifted, bringing the smell of diesel and decay. Diana stared at the burned woman, at her single intact eye. There was something familiar in that gaze, something that reminded her of the way the rollercoaster had looked from the bottom of the first drop\u2014inevitable and utterly personal.\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\"\n\n\"Come to the autopsy. Tomorrow. Rockland Medical Center, nine a.m. The M.E.'s a friend. He'll let you observe.\" Calhoun's voice dropped. \"And then you're going to tell me a story. Not the one you think I want to hear. The one this guy is actually telling.\"\n\n\"And if I get it wrong?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. Instead, he turned back to the water, pulling out another cigarette. \"You ever wonder why they build rollercoasters out of wood? All that engineering, all that precision, and they still use lumber. Know why?\"\n\nShe waited.\n\n\"Because wood breathes. It shifts. It remembers every rider who's ever screamed on it.\" He lit the cigarette, cupping his hands against the wind. \"Steel's just metal. But wood has memory.\"\n\n---\n\nThe autopsy room was colder than the harbor. Diana sat in a corner on a stool that wobbled, her notebook open in her lap, pen poised. She'd written nothing. The medical examiner\u2014a small, precise man named Dr. Chen\u2014worked with the methodical patience of a watchmaker. The body on the table was the lobster trap victim. The hands were indeed gone, the stumps capped with something that looked like wax.\n\n\"Defensive wounds on the forearms,\" Chen narrated for the recorder. \"Consistent with manual strangulation prior to dismemberment. Time of death approximately seventy-two hours before discovery. No water in the lungs, so she was dead before she went in the trap.\"\n\nDiana's pen moved: *Dead before the water. Not a drowning. A display.*\n\n\"Any ID?\" Calhoun asked. He stood with his arms crossed, his face giving away nothing.\n\n\"None. We're running dental, but...\" Chen shrugged. \"Could be weeks.\"\n\nThe woman's hair was dark, matted with salt and blood. Her face, what remained of it, suggested she might have been pretty. Might have been a lot of things. Diana forced herself to look, to really look, the way she'd forced herself to stare at the rollercoaster's highest point before the drop.\n\n*The terror isn't the fall. It's the knowing you chose to climb.*\n\nShe wrote: *He wants them seen. The trap, the lighthouse, the rental. All stages. All props.*\n\nChen moved to the Y-incision, scalpel flashing. The smell hit Diana then\u2014copper and something deeper, organic. She swallowed hard.\n\n\"Detective,\" she said, her voice sounding too loud in the tiled room. \"Can I see the other crime scene photos? The lighthouse?\"\n\nCalhoun's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. He pulled a folder from his briefcase, slid it across the counter. She opened it carefully, like it might bite.\n\nThe lighthouse interior was blackened, the walls streaked with soot. In the center of the floor, a shape that might have been human. The next photo: a close-up of the victim's face, or where the face should have been. The fire had done its work.\n\nBut it was the third photo that made Diana's breath catch. A detail in the corner, half-burned but still recognizable. A stack of books. Their covers were charred, but she could make out the spines. They were hers.\n\nHer novels. Her pretty lies. Her sanitized murders.\n\n\"He's read your work,\" Calhoun said quietly. \"All of them, near as we can tell. He quotes them in the scenes he leaves. Not exact quotes. He paraphrases. Gets them slightly wrong, like he's working from memory.\"\n\nThe room tilted. Diana gripped the counter. \"You knew.\"\n\n\"Yesterday morning, when I gave you the card. I knew then.\" He wasn't gloating. If anything, he sounded tired. \"The lobster trap? That's from *Blood Harbor*. Page 147. Your killer used a crab pot, but close enough. The fire? *Ashes of the Innocent*. You burned a priest alive in chapter twelve.\"\n\n\"I didn't\u2014\" She stopped. She had. She'd written those scenes, those deaths. She'd made them thrilling, romantic, inevitable.\n\nCalhoun leaned close, his voice a low rumble. \"This guy, he's not just killing. He's correcting you. He's showing you what it really looks like when someone takes your pretty ideas and makes them breathe.\"\n\nDiana looked at the dead woman, at the wax-capped stumps where hands should have been. She thought about the rollercoaster, the way the wood had groaned beneath them, the way it remembered every scream.\n\n\"What does he use?\" she asked, her voice hollow. \"For the hands. What does he use to...\"\n\n\"Bone saw. Surgical grade. We found traces of polymethyl methacrylate on the stumps. It's a type of acrylic. He seals the wounds.\" Chen glanced up, his eyes meeting Diana's over his mask. \"It's almost respectful. He doesn't want them to bleed out. He wants them intact. Preserved.\"\n\n*Preserved.* Diana wrote the word, underlined it three times. Then: *Not a killer. A curator.*\n\nThe room was silent except for the hum of the ventilation. Calhoun watched her, waiting for the liar to do what liars do best.\n\nDiana closed her notebook. \"I need to see the lighthouse. The actual scene. Not photos.\"\n\n\"That's not standard procedure.\"\n\n\"Neither is bringing a novelist to an autopsy.\"\n\nA muscle twitched in his jaw. \"Tomorrow. Low tide. I'll meet you at the parking lot. Don't bring your phone.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he calls them.\" Calhoun's expression was stone. \"The victims. Days before. Unknown number, untraceable. He tells them how it's going to happen. Gives them time to think about it.\"\n\nDiana felt the rollercoaster drop again, that moment of weightlessness before the terror caught up with the body.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because the second victim, the one in the lighthouse, she recorded it.\" He pulled out his own phone, played a video. A woman's face, tear-streaked, holding the camera herself. A voice in the background, distorted, mechanical: *\"You will burn because that's how the story ends. You don't get to choose the last chapter.\"*\n\nThe video cut to static.\n\nDiana stood, her legs unsteady. The stool clattered behind her. She made it to the sink before she threw up, the sound echoing off the tiles. When she straightened, Calhoun was holding out a paper towel.\n\n\"Welcome to the real story,\" he said. \"Now tell me how it ends.\"\n\nShe took the towel, wiped her mouth. Her reflection in the metal cabinet door looked like a stranger. The woman who'd climbed onto a rollercoaster three days ago had been playing at darkness. This woman, the one who'd just seen what darkness actually looked like, had only one choice left.\n\nShe had to climb higher.\n\n\"I don't know how it ends,\" she said. \"But I know what the next scene is.\"\n\nCalhoun waited.\n\n\"He's going to call me.\" Diana's voice was steady now, the liar's voice, the one she used to make fiction sound like truth. \"He's been calling them because they were stand-ins. Practice. But I'm the one he's been talking to all along. Through the books. He wants me to see.\"\n\n\"That's a lot of supposition.\"\n\n\"It's narrative logic.\" She met his eyes in the reflection. \"You brought me here because you know it too. The story's been building to this. I'm not a witness. I'm a character.\"\n\nFor the first time, Calhoun's cop mask cracked. Just a fraction. Just enough for Diana to see the doubt underneath, the fear that she might be right.\n\n\"Then you'd better start writing,\" he said. \"Because the next chapter's already begun, and I don't know the ending either.\"\n\nHe turned to leave, his coat brushing against the doorframe. Diana stood alone with the dead woman and the echo of a voice that wasn't quite human, wasn't quite mechanical. A voice that had learned to speak by reading her lies.\n\nShe opened her notebook to a fresh page. The cursor in her mind blinked, waiting.\n\nThen she wrote: *The killer called on a Tuesday. He sounded like wood groaning under weight, like something that remembered every scream.*\n\nIt was a start. It was also, she realized, the first true thing she'd written in years.\n\nThe dead woman on the table said nothing. But her one remaining eye seemed to follow Diana as she gathered her things, as she walked out into the corridor where Calhoun waited, as she stepped into a story that was no longer hers to invent.\n\nIt had been breathing all along. Now it had teeth."

      "content": "## Chapter 3: **The Sigh**\n\n*Wood remembers what the sea forgets.*\n\nThe burned-out lighthouse leaned against the sky like a question mark scorched into parchment. Diana stood at the base of the tower, her notebook clutched against her chest, and thought about the architecture of grief. The stones were blackened with salt and soot, the spiral staircase inside reduced to charred ribs. The lantern room had collapsed inward, a shattered eye that had once watched the Atlantic scream itself against the rocks.\n\nCalhoun stood beside her, his tweed jacket dark with rain. He hadn't spoken since they'd parked the unmarked car a quarter-mile back, picking their way along the cliff path in silence. The only sound was the ocean below, chewing at the granite with patient teeth.\n\n\"Third victim,\" Calhoun said finally. \"Fire started around three a.m. The keeper\u2014old man named Walter Poole\u2014was inside. They identified him by his keys, melted into his hip pocket.\"\n\nDiana wrote: *Keys in the bone. Identification by metal.* Her pen shook. \"The other victims. The lobster trap. Tell me again.\"\n\n\"First was a woman. Sarah Chen. Lobsterwoman out of Stonington. Found her trap floating off Eagle Island, her inside. No hands. No tongue.\" He paused, watching Diana's pen move. \"Second was a man. Jacob Torres. Works\u2014worked\u2014at the fairground. The rollercoaster.\"\n\nDiana's pen stopped. The wind caught the page, fluttering it like a white flag.\n\n\"Maintenance,\" Calhoun continued. \"They found him in the operator's booth. Burned. Same night as the lighthouse. Same accelerant. Same signature.\"\n\n\"What signature?\"\n\nCalhoun reached into his coat, pulled out a plastic evidence bag. Inside, a small rectangle of wood, carved with intricate whorls and knots. It looked like a fragment of a larger puzzle, a piece of something that had once been whole. \"Found this at both scenes. Under the trap. Under the booth. It's from the coaster.\"\n\nDiana took the bag. The wood was smooth, worn by decades of hands and weather. She could feel the grain through the plastic, could almost hear it breathing. \"The coaster's been here since '68. It's famous. People come from all over to ride it.\"\n\n\"People come to die,\" Calhoun said. \"They just don't know it yet.\"\n\nShe turned the bag over. The carving was deliberate, precise. Not random graffiti. A pattern. A language. \"It looks like\u2014\" She stopped. Her own words echoed back at her, from a novel she'd written three years ago. *The killer left his stories in the grain of things, carving his confession into wood because wood was the only thing that wouldn't lie.*\n\nCalhoun was watching her. \"Looks like what?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She handed the bag back. \"Just something I wrote.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, his voice flat. \"That's the problem.\"\n\nThey climbed the lighthouse stairs. Each step groaned underfoot, a chorus of wooden sighs that rose from the depths of the tower. Diana counted them\u2014thirty-seven steps, each one a vertebra in the spine of something ancient and dying. The air inside was thick with the smell of charred pine and old kerosene. At the top, the lantern room opened to the sky, a cage of twisted metal and shattered glass.\n\nIn the center of the room, a circle of stones marked where the keeper's bed had been. A metal frame remained, the mattress reduced to a black stain. Diana knelt beside it, her fingers tracing the pattern of the carving in the air above the stones.\n\n\"He was alive when it started,\" she said. It wasn't a question.\n\n\"Medical examiner says smoke inhalation. He died before the flames reached him. Small mercy.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing.\" Diana's voice sounded distant, borrowed. \"Mercy is just another word for narrative convenience.\"\n\nCalhoun leaned against the wall. The wood behind him creaked, a long exhalation that seemed to come from the bones of the lighthouse itself. \"You need to stop talking like that.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like you're narrating your own life.\" He pushed off the wall, and the sigh came again, louder this time, as if the entire structure had drawn breath. \"The killer's reading your books, Diana. Not just reading them. Studying them. Using them as blueprints. You wrote about a lighthouse fire in your second novel. *The Salt Keeper.*\"\n\n\"I wrote about a lot of things.\"\n\n\"You wrote about a woman in a lobster trap. Chapter seven. *The Weight of Water.*\"\n\nDiana's notebook slipped from her hands. The pages fanned open, revealing her handwriting, dense and desperate. \"That was different. That was\u2014\"\n\n\"Fiction?\" Calhoun's laugh was bitter. \"Tell that to Sarah Chen's daughter. She's seven. I had to explain why Mommy wasn't coming home. I used small words. They didn't help.\"\n\nThe wind shifted. The lighthouse groaned, a deep, structural sound that rose from its foundation. Wood against stone. Memory against forgetting. Diana could feel it in her teeth.\n\n\"He's not copying my books,\" she said, picking up her notebook. \"He's correcting them.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My books end. The killer gets caught. Justice happens.\" She stood, brushing soot from her knees. \"That's not how it works in real life. He knows that. He's showing me.\"\n\n\"Showing you what?\"\n\n\"The difference between a story and a confession.\" She walked to the edge of the room, where the wall had fallen away, opening onto the cliff and the sea beyond. \"I write about darkness like it's a place you can visit and come back from. He's showing me that darkness is a current. You don't visit it. It visits you.\"\n\nCalhoun joined her at the edge. Below, the waves crashed against the rocks, sending up plumes of white spray that looked like ghosts trying to escape. \"We found something else. In the keeper's logbook.\"\n\nHe pulled a small notebook from his pocket, flipped it open. On the page, in a shaky hand, the words: *He came at dusk. He sounded like the house settling. Like something remembering.*\n\n\"Walter wrote that the night he died,\" Calhoun said. \"Sound familiar?\"\n\nDiana's throat closed. The voice in the morgue. The voice on the phone that hadn't happened yet. *Wood groaning under weight. Something that remembered every scream.*\n\n\"He's been here,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yeah. And he's not done.\" Calhoun pointed to the horizon, where a dark line of clouds was building. \"Storm's coming. The kind that takes down trees. The kind that uncovers things.\"\n\nThe lighthouse sighed again, a long, low sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once. Diana felt it in her ribs, in the hollow places where her certainty used to live. She opened her notebook to a fresh page, but the words wouldn't come. For the first time in her career, she didn't know what happened next.\n\nThen her phone rang.\n\nThe sound was absurd in the ruined tower, a digital chirp against the ancient groan of wood and stone. She pulled it from her pocket. Unknown number. The screen showed a text message, just three words: *Look behind you.*\n\nCalhoun saw her face. \"What?\"\n\n\"Don't,\" she said, but he was already turning, his hand moving to his hip, to the gun that wasn't there because this was a crime scene and he wasn't on duty. He was just a man in a ruined tower with a woman who wrote horror stories for a living.\n\nBehind them, in the corner where the shadows were deepest, something moved. Not a person. Not a shape. A shift in the darkness itself, as if the night had decided to try on a new form. The wood sighed again, but this time it was different. This time, it sounded like a voice.\n\n*\"You wrote me wrong,\"* it said. *\"All these years, you wrote me wrong.\"*\n\nThe words came from everywhere, from the charred beams, from the stones, from the very air. They had weight, texture. They sounded like a man speaking through a mouthful of splinters.\n\nCalhoun froze. \"Show yourself.\"\n\n*\"I am shown,\"* the voice replied. *\"In every beam. In every grain. I am the story you told when you thought no one was listening.\"*\n\nDiana's phone rang again. Another text: *The rollercoaster. Midnight. Come alone or the next fire won't be empty.*\n\nShe showed Calhoun. He read it twice, his jaw tight. \"We're not going.\"\n\n\"We have to.\"\n\n\"He's baiting you.\"\n\n\"He's *writing* me.\" Diana's voice was steadier than she felt. \"And I need to see how this chapter ends.\"\n\nCalhoun grabbed her arm, his fingers hard. \"This isn't a book. You don't get to turn the page and make it better.\"\n\n\"Then what do I do?\" She pulled free. \"Wait for him to burn down the entire coast? To carve my next novel into someone's bones?\"\n\n\"You let me do my job.\"\n\n\"Your job didn't save Walter Poole.\" She gestured to the blackened room. \"Your job didn't save Sarah Chen or Jacob Torres. He's not playing by your rules. He's playing by mine.\"\n\nThe lighthouse groaned, a sound of agreement. Or warning. The two were becoming indistinguishable.\n\nCalhoun's phone buzzed. He checked it, and his face went pale. He turned the screen toward her. A photo. The rollercoaster, its wooden spine stark against the night sky. In the front car, a figure sat slumped, a splash of red against the weathered wood.\n\n\"That's the attendant,\" Calhoun said. \"The one who let you ride.\"\n\nDiana felt the world tilt. The attendant who'd asked if she wanted to go again. The bored kid with acne and a name tag she couldn't remember. Now just another sentence in a story she hadn't meant to tell.\n\n\"He's accelerating,\" Calhoun said. \"The timeline's collapsing.\"\n\n\"Or he's just getting to the good part.\" Diana's writer's mind, that treacherous thing, was already framing it: *The third act begins with a body in the front car. The writer has to ride to understand.*\n\nShe looked at Calhoun. \"You have a choice. You can arrest me for obstruction. Or you can drive me to the fairground and we can see what happens when the story catches up to the person who wrote it.\"\n\nThe lighthouse sighed one last time, a long, exhaled breath of wood and memory and smoke. Somewhere in the sound, Diana could hear the rollercoaster's chain lift, could feel the first drop in her stomach.\n\nCalhoun didn't answer. He just turned and started down the stairs, his footsteps heavy on the sighing wood. Diana followed, her notebook clutched like a shield, her phone heavy with messages she hadn't asked for.\n\nOutside, the storm had reached the shore. Rain began to fall, thick and cold. But in the distance, the fairground lights flickered to life, a constellation of false stars calling them back to the place where this had begun.\n\nThe rollercoaster waited, its wooden bones groaning under the weight of the coming night. And somewhere in its structure, in its memory of screams and laughter and the terror of the climb, the killer was already writing the next page.\n\nDiana just had to decide if she was brave enough to read it."

      "title": "**Chapter and Verse**",
      "content": "## Chapter 4: **Chapter and Verse**\n\n*The killer read her books like scripture, and every murder was a citation.*\n\nThe rain came in horizontal sheets, a baptism by force. Calhoun's old Crown Victoria hydroplaned twice on the coastal road, and both times Diana watched his knuckles whiten on the wheel without a word of complaint. The storm was a character now, had earned its place in the narrative\u2014no longer atmosphere but accomplice, washing away evidence, muting sirens, turning the world into a closed room with no witnesses.\n\n\"He had a name,\" Calhoun said finally, his voice barely audible over the windshield wipers' frantic metronome. \"The attendant. Marcus Vance. Nineteen. Worked summers to pay for community college. Wanted to study marine biology.\"\n\nDiana said nothing. In her books, the victims were always sketches\u2014waitress with a secret, fisherman with a debt, teenager who should have known better. She'd never had to carry their real names before, their unrealized futures. The weight of it pressed against her ribs like shrapnel.\n\n\"Did he have hands?\" she asked.\n\nCalhoun's jaw tightened. \"When we get there, you don't touch anything. You don't contaminate my scene with your writer's bullshit. You look, you listen, and you tell me what this psycho wants from you. That's it.\"\n\n\"He wants me to finish the story.\"\n\n\"Stories end, Diana. This one ends with a cell door or a body bag. Preferably his.\"\n\nBut they both knew that was a lie. The best stories never ended clean. They left splinters.\n\nThe fairground rose out of the storm like a half-remembered dream. Yellow police tape fluttered at the entrance, but the local uniforms had retreated to their cruisers, coffee steaming against the windows. The storm had downgraded them from investigators to security guards. Calhoun flashed his badge and they ducked under the tape, the rain instantly soaking through Diana's jacket, finding the hollows between her shoulder blades.\n\nThe rollercoaster waited at the center of it all, its wooden spine a dark cathedral against the sodium lights. It groaned\u2014not with the wind, but with memory. Diana could feel it in her teeth, that same groan from the phone call, from the lighthouse's final breath. The killer had learned to speak in the voice of old wood, and this was his pulpit.\n\nA single patrol officer stood at the base of the coaster, looking miserable. \"Detective. Medical examiner's on the way, but the bridge is out on Route One. Could be an hour.\"\n\n\"She's not here for him,\" Calhoun said, gesturing to Diana. \"She's here for the message.\"\n\nThey climbed. The wooden steps were slick, treacherous, each one giving slightly underfoot like the ribs of a sleeping beast. The rain made the world a watercolor, blurring the distinction between sea and sky and earth. Up close, the coaster's structure was a labyrinth of beams and bolts, a architecture of controlled collapse. Diana counted her steps, a habit from childhood nightmares, and realized she was counting in chapters.\n\nOne. Two. Three.\n\nThe body sat in the lead car, just as the photo had shown. Marcus Vance's head lolled against the safety bar, his acne-scarred face peaceful in a way that felt obscene. The blood on his shirt was still wet, mixing with rain, running down the car's wooden side in thin red rivers. His hands were still attached. That detail, at least, had been merciful.\n\nBut his lap was another story.\n\nA book rested there, held in place by his dead hands. Her book. *The Cold Harbor*, her second novel, the one where the killer staged bodies in maritime settings\u2014fisherman's shack, abandoned cannery, lighthouse. The lighthouse. She'd written that scene three months before the real one burned.\n\n\"Don't,\" Calhoun warned, but Diana was already reaching.\n\nThe book was open to Chapter Twelve. The margins were filled with cramped, precise handwriting. Not a defacement\u2014a commentary. A sermon. She read the first line, her own words: *The body in the lobster trap had no hands.*\n\nBeneath it, in that wood-groan voice made ink: *But the boy in the coaster car kept his. For now. Chapter Fourteen, Verse Six. \"The terror isn't the fall. It's the knowing you chose to climb.\"*\n\nHer own words. The words Calhoun had spoken to her on the ride. The killer had been there, listening, or he was Calhoun, or he was somehow inside both of them, a ghost in the machine of their shared terror.\n\n\"That's not published,\" she whispered. \"That line. I wrote it in my notebook after the ride. It's not in any manuscript.\"\n\nCalhoun's hand was on her elbow, pulling her back. \"You're telling me this guy hacked your computer?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you he's not reading my books. He's reading my mind.\"\n\nThe wind shifted, and the book's pages fluttered, revealing more marginalia. Chapter numbers. Verse numbers. A map of murders she hadn't yet committed on paper, but had imagined. The lobster trap\u2014Chapter Three, Verse Two. The lighthouse\u2014Chapter Seven, Verse Nine. Each one cross-referenced to her own unpublished outlines, the files she kept in a password-protected folder called \"Research.\"\n\n\"How?\" Calhoun asked, and for the first time he sounded like a man who needed an answer, not just evidence.\n\nDiana's fingers found her phone, opened the cloud storage app. The folder was empty. Not deleted\u2014never uploaded. She'd written those outlines offline, paranoid about leaks, about piracy. The only place they existed was on her laptop and in a notebook she carried everywhere.\n\nThe notebook in her bag right now.\n\nShe opened it with trembling hands, rain smearing the ink. The outlines were there, intact. But in the margins, mirroring the killer's handwriting from the book, were notes she hadn't written. Chapter Fourteen, Verse Six: *The fairground. The boy who asked if she wanted to go again. Make her see that wanting is the same as choosing.*\n\n\"I didn't write this,\" she said, but even as she said it, she recognized the loop of the g's, the slash through the seven. It was her handwriting. Her hand, moving while she slept, while she rode the coaster, while she thought she was choosing to climb.\n\nCalhoun saw it too. She could tell by the way he stepped back, putting air between them, his cop instincts screaming that the person closest to the killer is always the killer.\n\n\"You need to come in,\" he said. \"Not as a suspect. As\u2014\"\n\n\"As what?\" She closed the notebook, held it to her chest like a shield. \"A collaborator? A medium? I'm not writing his story, Calhoun. He's writing mine.\"\n\nHer phone buzzed. Unknown number. She showed him the screen, and he nodded once, sharp. Answer it. Put it on speaker. Trace this, his eyes said to the storm, to God, to anyone listening.\n\nShe swiped accept.\n\nThe voice was wood groaning, wind through dead pines, the sound of a rollercoaster climbing its first hill. \"Chapter Fourteen, Verse Seven. 'She stood in the rain and understood that every story is a confession, even the ones we think we're making up.'\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Calhoun barked, but the voice continued, speaking only to Diana.\n\n\"You wanted to know what truth looked like. It looks like your own hand, moving when you thought you were asleep. It looks like a boy who asked if you wanted to go again, and you said yes. You chose the climb, Diana. I'm just providing the drop.\"\n\nThe line went dead. In the silence, the rollercoaster groaned, a long, satisfied sound. Diana looked at her notebook, at the words she'd supposedly written while unconscious, and saw the truth the killer wanted her to see.\n\nChapter Fourteen was the chapter she'd been avoiding. The one where the writer becomes the killer, where the story eats its own author.\n\n\"He's not copying my books,\" she said, her voice steady now, the liar's voice, the one that made fiction sound like truth. \"He's making me write his. And every time I figure out the next scene, I give him the verse.\"\n\nCalhoun's phone buzzed. He looked at it, and his face went from pale to gray. \"Medical examiner's here. But they just found another one. Up the coast. In a place called The Anchor Inn.\"\n\nDiana's stomach dropped. The Anchor Inn was Chapter Fourteen, Verse One in her current outline. The one where the killer leaves a body in a honeymoon suite, surrounded by the pages of a manuscript.\n\nHer manuscript.\n\n\"The drop,\" she whispered. \"He's accelerating because I'm catching up. The story's writing itself now.\"\n\nCalhoun looked at the dead boy in the coaster car, at the book in his lap, at Diana holding her notebook like a bomb that might go off if she turned the wrong page.\n\n\"Then stop writing,\" he said.\n\nBut she was already pulling out a pen, already opening to a blank page. The only way to beat a story that was writing itself was to write faster, to change the ending before he could read it.\n\nHer fingers hovered over the paper. The rain slowed. The wind held its breath. Somewhere, a killer waited for the next verse.\n\nShe wrote: *The killer made one mistake. He thought the author was the god of the story. But gods don't bleed.*\n\nIt was a start. It was also, she knew, a direct challenge. The rollercoaster groaned again, and this time it sounded like laughter.\n\nBelow, the medical examiner's van pulled up, its lights painting the wet pavement red. But up here, in the wooden bones of the ride, Diana and Calhoun stood in the space between what she'd written and what he'd done, and the only thing separating them from the next verse was the speed of her pen.\n\nThe killer had given her a choice: keep writing pretty lies, or finally learn what truth looked like, even if it broke her.\n\nShe chose to break it.\n\nThe pen moved. The story turned. And somewhere in the storm, a phone rang with the next chapter, but this time, Diana was the one dialing."

      "content": "## Chapter 5: **Person of Interest**\n\n*Every debt comes due. The trick is making sure you're the one holding the ledger.*\n\nThe rain turned the fairground into a watercolor smear, neon bleeding into mud. Diana's boots sank into the churned earth as she followed Calhoun down from the rollercoaster's platform, the wooden steps slick with grief and weather. Behind them, the ride groaned in the wind, a skeletal choir singing to the dead. The attendant\u2014his name had been Tyler, she learned from the uniformed officer at the base\u2014remained in the front car, his body a comma punctuating a sentence Diana hadn't meant to write.\n\n\"We need to talk about your phone,\" Calhoun said, not turning around. His shoulders were a line of tension under his wet coat.\n\n\"My phone?\" Diana's hand instinctively went to her pocket, to the weight of it, the messages she hadn't asked for.\n\n\"He sent the photo to me. But he sent something to you, too. While we were up there.\" It wasn't a question. Cops learned to read silence the way Diana read body language: as confession.\n\nShe pulled it out. The screen was dark, but when she thumbed it awake, there it was. A text from a blocked number, timestamped three minutes ago: *Verse Two needs a witness. You're taking too long.*\n\nBelow it, a photo of The Anchor Inn. Room 14. The honeymoon suite. Through the window, a shape hung from the ceiling fan, turning slow as a mobile.\n\nDiana's breath hitched. In her outline, the victim in Chapter Fourteen was a literary critic who'd panned her second book. A symbolic kill, all metaphor and spite. But this\u2014this was real flesh, real rope, real weight.\n\n\"He's not just using your books,\" Calhoun said, his voice low enough that the uniforms milling around wouldn't hear. \"He's editing them. Improving them.\"\n\nThe implication landed like a fist. Her stories were rough drafts. His were final, published in blood.\n\nA black sedan pulled up, tires hissing on wet asphalt. A woman in a sharp blazer stepped out, her face all angles and authority. She looked at Diana first, not the crime scene. \"Detective Calhoun. Your office said I'd find you here. And this is?\"\n\n\"Diana Lane,\" Calhoun said. \"Consultant.\"\n\n\"Person of interest,\" the woman corrected. She flashed a badge: FBI. \"Agent Kline. We need to have a conversation about jurisdiction, Detective. And about why your consultant's books keep predicting murders.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Anchor Inn sat on a rocky outcrop twenty miles up the coast, a weathered clapboard building that had seen better decades. The honeymoon suite was on the second floor, its windows facing the Atlantic, which hammered the shore like it was trying to erase something. Diana had written the scene in November, describing the room's faded romance: the heart-shaped tub, the champagne flutes dusty from disuse, the ceiling fan that turned with a sound like dry bones scraping.\n\nReality was worse.\n\nThe victim\u2014identified by the manager as a traveling salesman named Paul Hendricks\u2014hung from the fan, which had indeed groaned under his weight. But the killer had added details Diana hadn't imagined. The walls were papered with manuscript pages, her manuscript, each one pinned with fishing line. They fluttered in the breeze from the open window like a flock of pale moths. On the bed, arranged in a neat circle, were copies of all her books. Each cover had a hole drilled through the center, as if shot.\n\n\"Tell me about him,\" Agent Kline said. She stood in the doorway, blocking escape. \"Not the killer. This one.\" She gestured to the dead man, who spun slowly, showing them the back of his head, then his face, then the back again.\n\n\"I don't know him.\"\n\n\"But you killed him.\"\n\nCalhoun shifted. \"Agent Kline, that's not\u2014\"\n\n\"In her book, Detective. In her book, she killed a critic. This man had a receipt in his wallet from a Portland bookstore. He bought her latest novel yesterday.\" Kline's eyes were flint. \"So I'm asking: did she know him? Did she talk to him? Did she give him a signed copy and a smile that said *you're next*?\"\n\nDiana's writer's mind catalogued the scene: the interrogation, the power play, the rhythm of Kline's speech. She was being framed in real-time, not by the killer but by the logic of investigation. *When the pattern matches, you match the pattern.*\n\n\"He bought the book,\" Diana said, her voice steady. \"He read it. He probably didn't even remember it by morning. But the killer did. The killer remembers everything I write, because he's not reading for pleasure. He's reading for instructions.\"\n\n\"Convenient,\" Kline said. \"A fan who takes things too far. How original.\"\n\n\"It's not original,\" Diana snapped. \"That's the point. He's using my lack of originality against me. My laziness. My tropes.\" She gestured to the walls, to the pages that had become wallpaper. \"I wrote a scene in a honeymoon suite because it was atmospheric. Because it was easy. He made it real because for him, easy is a blueprint.\"\n\nKline studied her. \"You sound like you admire him.\"\n\n\"I sound like I understand him,\" Diana corrected. \"That's my job. That's why Calhoun brought me in.\"\n\n\"Calhoun brought you in because you were already here,\" Kline said. \"Because you rode that rollercoaster three days before a body showed up on it. Because you have no alibi for any of the murders, and because your phone is the only one receiving messages from our unsub.\" She took a step closer. \"You're not a consultant, Ms. Lane. You're a suspect who writes her own probable cause.\"\n\nThe words landed like a verdict. Diana looked to Calhoun, but his face was stone. He'd known this was coming. Maybe he'd even agreed to it.\n\n\"Detective,\" Kline said, \"please escort Ms. Lane to the station. We'll be executing a warrant for her computers, her notes, and her phone records. And Ms. Lane? I'd advise you to get a lawyer. A good one.\"\n\n---\n\nThe interrogation room was smaller than Diana expected. In her books, she always made them claustrophobic, a box where truth had nowhere to hide. Reality was more mundane: beige walls, a metal table, a camera blinking in the corner. They'd taken her notebook, her phone, her pen. All her weapons.\n\nCalhoun sat across from her, silent. The good cop gone bad, or maybe just gone.\n\n\"You're letting her do this,\" Diana said.\n\n\"I'm not letting anything. She's FBI. Three murders in two states makes this hers.\" He leaned forward. \"But she's not wrong, Diana. You are the connection. You are the pattern.\"\n\n\"So arrest me.\"\n\n\"If I thought you did it, you'd be cuffed.\" His voice was low, urgent. \"But I think you're being played. And I think you're so deep in the game you can't see the board.\"\n\n\"The killer\u2014\"\n\n\"The killer is smart. He knows we'd bring you in. He wants you here, in this room, while he's out there writing the next chapter.\" Calhoun's eyes flicked to the camera, then back. \"So write.\"\n\n\"I don't have\u2014\"\n\n\"Not with a pen. With your head.\" He tapped his temple. \"You've got the whole story in there. So finish it. Change it. Give me an ending that doesn't end with you in prison or in a coffin.\"\n\nDiana closed her eyes. The pages she'd pinned to the walls at The Anchor Inn, the words she'd written in a coffee shop six months ago, they came back in fragments. The critic, the honeymoon suite, the ceiling fan. She'd written it as a commentary on disposable culture, on how easy it was to kill a man's reputation. The killer had read it as literal.\n\n*He thought the author was the god of the story. But gods don't bleed.*\n\nHer own words, her challenge. What had she meant? That she wasn't in control? That he wasn't? Or was it just a pretty line, the kind she strung together when she wanted to sound profound?\n\n\"The mistake,\" she said, opening her eyes. \"In every book, the killer makes a mistake. Not because he's stupid, but because he can't help himself. He leaves a part of himself at the scene.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"In *Blood Wood*, it was the watch. He left his father's watch at the third murder. In *Cold Frame*, it was the cigarettes. He smoked a brand that only had one distributor in the state.\" She was thinking aloud, the way she did when plot points started connecting. \"This killer isn't leaving things. He's leaving *me*. My words, my scenes, my chapters. He's not trying to get away with it. He's trying to get away *with* me.\"\n\nCalhoun's expression shifted. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means he's not done.\" Diana leaned forward, mirroring him. \"Agent Kline thinks I'm the person of interest because I connect the victims. But I'm not the connection. I'm the *target*. The victims are just footnotes. He's writing me into the story, Detective. And the final chapter is always the one where the author dies.\"\n\nThe door opened. Kline stood there, holding a manila envelope. \"Forensics from the coaster,\" she said, sliding it across the table. \"We found something in the boy's hand. It was clenched so tight, they had to pry his fingers open.\"\n\nInside, a photo. Tyler's hand, his knuckles white even in death. In his palm, a small rectangle of paper. Not a photo. Not a note.\n\nA business card.\n\n*Diana Lane. Novelist.*\n\nIt was from a conference she'd attended two years ago. She'd handed them out like candy, desperate for any reader. This one was worn soft at the edges, carried like a talisman. On the back, in a handwriting she recognized from the manuscript pages at The Anchor Inn, was a single line: *Verse Three is where we meet.*\n\nKline looked at her. \"Care to revise your statement, Ms. Lane?\"\n\nDiana stared at the card. The killer had carried it. Had held it while he killed Tyler. Had placed it in the dead boy's hand like a bookmark.\n\n\"He's not just writing the story,\" she whispered. \"He's giving me credit.\"\n\nThe phone in the interrogation room rang. Not her phone. The room phone. A hard line, black and institutional. Kline answered, listened, then held it out to Diana.\n\n\"He's asking for you,\" she said. \"By name.\"\n\nDiana took the receiver. It was cold, heavy. She pressed it to her ear and heard the sound she'd been dreading: wood groaning under weight, a chain lift clicking upward, the first drop screaming through the dark.\n\n\"Hello, Diana,\" the voice said. It was the rollercoaster speaking, the wood and the wind and the memory of every scream. \"Verse Three is where the author becomes the character. I'm waiting. Same seat. One hour.\"\n\nThe line went dead.\n\nKline was already moving, calling for a trace, for units to the fairground. But Diana knew better. The killer didn't want the cops. He wanted the writer.\n\nAnd the only way to end a story that was writing itself was to walk into the final chapter and change the last line.\n\nShe looked at Calhoun. \"You wanted an ending. I'm going to give you one.\"\n\n\"That's not how this works,\" Kline snapped. \"You're staying here. You're a suspect.\"\n\n\"No,\" Calhoun said, standing. \"She's bait.\" He grabbed Diana's arm, pulled her up. \"And I'm the chaperone.\"\n\nThey left Kline shouting into her radio, left the interrogation room with its beige walls and blinking camera. Left the station and stepped into the rain, which had turned to mist, a veil between what was written and what was real.\n\nIn the car, Calhoun tossed her a notebook. \"Write faster,\" he said.\n\nDiana opened it, pen hovering over the blank page. The fairground lights flickered in the distance, a constellation calling them back to where this began.\n\nShe wrote: *The killer waited in the front car, but he wasn't alone. He'd brought the author a gift: the truth about why stories end.*\n\nIt wasn't a line she'd planned. It wasn't in any outline. But it was the first thing that felt like it might be enough.\n\nThe car engine turned over. The story, finally, was hers to write."

      "content": "## Chapter 6: **Research or Alibi**\n\n*The difference between a novelist and a killer is paper trails. One leaves them intentionally.*\n\nThe rain turned to mist somewhere between the police station and the fairground, a slow dissolve that felt like a scene transition Diana hadn't written. In the passenger seat of Calhoun's unmarked sedan, she wrote with the notebook balanced on her knees, the pen moving in the jittery rhythm of bad pavement. Each bump was a comma. Each pothole, a period. The story was coming in staccato bursts now, machine-gun prose.\n\nCalhoun hadn't spoken since they'd left Kline shouting behind them. His silence was a third passenger, heavy and judgmental. Diana could feel him watching her from the corner of his eye, could sense the question he wasn't asking: *How much of this did you plan?*\n\nShe wrote: *The detective drove with one hand on the wheel and the other on his doubt. He wanted to believe the author was innocent, but innocence was a first draft\u2014always messy, always full of holes.*\n\n\"That's not helping,\" Calhoun said.\n\nDiana didn't look up. \"You don't know what I'm writing.\"\n\n\"I know the sound of someone digging their own grave. I've heard it in a hundred interrogation rooms. The pen's just quieter than the shovel.\"\n\nShe stopped writing. Outside, the fairground lights bled through the fog, turning the world into an overexposed photograph. The rollercoaster's silhouette rose above it all, a wooden spine against a gray sky. Even from here, she could hear it groaning.\n\n\"You're thinking about my research,\" she said. It wasn't a question.\n\n\"I'm thinking about your browser history. Your GPS. The fact that every murder site you've got in that notebook of yours, you've visited. Some of them twice.\"\n\n\"That's what research is.\"\n\n\"That's what a prosecutor calls premeditation.\"\n\nDiana turned to him. \"You think I'm giving myself an alibi by turning myself into a victim?\"\n\n\"I think you're smart enough to know that the best alibis are the ones you build before you need them.\" He pulled into the fairground's empty parking lot, the tires crunching on gravel. \"Anchor Inn. You stayed there three months ago. The night manager remembers you asking about the honeymoon suite.\"\n\n\"I was writing about it.\"\n\n\"You were casing it.\"\n\nThe car stopped. Calhoun killed the engine but didn't move to get out. The fog pressed against the windows, making the world outside feel like a set piece waiting for direction.\n\n\"Let me see your phone,\" he said.\n\nDiana handed it over without argument. He scrolled through her photos, her notes, the trail of digital breadcrumbs every writer leaves. She watched his face harden as he found the pictures: the Anchor Inn's balcony, the rollercoaster's maintenance shed, the attendant's name tag\u2014close-up, detailed, time-stamped.\n\n\"These aren't research,\" Calhoun said. \"These are surveillance.\"\n\n\"I write crime novels. Detail matters.\"\n\n\"So does opportunity.\" He held up the phone, showing her a photo of the rollercoaster's control panel. \"This was taken last week. The same day the attendant was killed.\"\n\nDiana felt the ground shift. \"I didn't take that.\"\n\n\"It's your phone.\"\n\n\"I didn't take that picture.\"\n\nCalhoun studied her, his detective's eyes peeling back layers. She recognized the look. She'd written it a dozen times. *The moment when the detective realizes the suspect might be telling the truth, which is worse than knowing they're lying.*\n\n\"Someone's in my accounts,\" she said. \"My cloud storage. They've been planting\u2014\"\n\n\"Convenient.\"\n\n\"\u2014evidence. Yes. Very. That's the point.\"\n\nOutside, the rollercoaster groaned, a long, low sound like a whale breaching. The mist swirled around its base, and for a moment, Diana saw a figure moving beneath the tracks. There and gone, a flicker of shadow.\n\nCalhoun saw it too. He was out of the car before she could speak, his hand on his weapon. Diana followed, the notebook clutched to her chest like armor. The gravel was slick underfoot, the air thick with the smell of ozone and fried dough from abandoned concession stands.\n\nThe fairground was a ghost town in the off-season, but the rollercoaster was alive. Its wooden bones creaked and settled, the chain lift rattling in the wind. It shouldn't have been moving. The park was closed. The power should have been off.\n\nBut the lights were on.\n\nNot the floodlights. The ride's lights\u2014the amber bulbs that lined the track, the red glow of the exit sign, the green luminescence of the safety placard. They flickered in sequence, a heartbeat.\n\n\"The hell?\" Calhoun muttered.\n\nDiana stepped closer, her writer's mind cataloging details: fresh scratches on the control booth door, a coffee cup from a local diner that hadn't been open in six months, a single red balloon tied to the entrance gate.\n\nShe wrote: *The killer left breadcrumbs, but they were made of bone. Each one a question: Who's hunting who?*\n\n\"Stay behind me,\" Calhoun said, but Diana was already moving toward the coaster. The pull was physical, a gravity she'd written into existence and now couldn't escape. The wooden stairs to the loading platform were damp, each step giving slightly under her weight, as if the entire structure was breathing.\n\nAt the top, the first car waited. The front car. Where the attendant's body had been found.\n\nIt was empty now. Clean. No blood, no sign of violence. But in the seat, centered perfectly, was a manila envelope. Her name was typed on the front. Not her pen name. Her real name. The one she hadn't used since her first book, before she'd buried it under pseudonyms and author photos that never quite looked like her.\n\n\"Don't touch it,\" Calhoun said, but she was already reaching.\n\nInside, there were photographs. Dozens of them. Her, at various locations. The Anchor Inn. The lighthouse from Chapter Three. A diner in Portland where she'd written the prologue. Each photo was time-stamped, dated, and annotated in a handwriting she didn't recognize.\n\n*Research trip, Day 1. Author notes location of security cameras.*\n\n*Scouting mission. Author measures distance from road to entrance.*\n\n*Alibi establishment. Author speaks with witness.*\n\nThe last photo showed her sitting in this very rollercoaster car, three weeks ago. She remembered that day. She'd come to ride it one last time before writing the scene. The attendant had been there, the bored kid with acne. He'd asked if she wanted to go again. She'd said yes.\n\nThe photo was taken from the control booth. Someone had been watching her watch him.\n\n\"These make you look like a planner,\" Calhoun said, his voice flat.\n\n\"These make me look like a puppet.\"\n\nBeneath the photos, there was a single sheet of paper. Typed, centered, the format unmistakable.\n\n*Chapter Six: Research or Alibi*\n\n*The author arrived at the scene of her final chapter, accompanied by the detective who should have arrested her. She believed she was there to catch the killer. The killer knew she was there to be caught.*\n\n*The evidence was already filed. The timeline was already written. The only thing left to decide was whether this was research for a novel\u2014or an alibi for a murder spree.*\n\n*Verse One: The detective finds the knife in the author's car.*\n\nCalhoun's head snapped up. He stared at her, then at the parking lot where his sedan sat, fog swirling around its tires.\n\n\"Don't,\" Diana said, but he was already moving, taking the stairs two at a time. She followed, her notebook falling open, pages fluttering in the wind. The story was writing itself in real-time now, each beat landing like a punch.\n\nBy the time she reached the car, Calhoun had the trunk open. Inside, nestled between her spare tire and a bag of promotional bookmarks, was a hunting knife. The blade was clean, but the handle was wrapped in duct tape\u2014exactly as she'd described it in Chapter Two.\n\n\"That's not mine,\" Diana said, but even she could hear how thin it sounded.\n\nCalhoun didn't draw his weapon, but his hand hovered near it. \"Step away from the car.\"\n\n\"You know this is wrong. You know I'm being set up.\"\n\n\"I know what I see.\"\n\n\"Then look harder.\" She pointed at the knife. \"In my book, the killer wraps the handle because he's missing two fingers on his left hand. He needs the grip.\"\n\nCalhoun's jaw tightened. \"So?\"\n\n\"So unwrap it. See if there's blood under the tape. See if it's designed for a hand that's not whole.\"\n\nFor a moment, she thought he'd arrest her. The mist thickened, the rollercoaster groaned, and the world held its breath. Then Calhoun reached into the trunk, pulled on a pair of gloves from his pocket, and carefully unwrapped the tape.\n\nThe handle underneath was custom-molded. For a hand with three fingers.\n\n\"Shit,\" he whispered.\n\nThe rollercoaster's lights flickered again, and this time, they both saw the figure. Standing on the loading platform, where they'd just been. A silhouette, tall and thin, with one arm that ended too soon.\n\n\"Police!\" Calhoun shouted, drawing his weapon. \"Show me your hands!\"\n\nThe figure didn't move. Didn't speak. It just stood there, a shadow against the amber lights, and then it stepped backward, melting into the structure of the coaster itself.\n\nCalhoun ran. Diana followed, but her foot caught on something\u2014a root, a board, her own damn luck\u2014and she went down hard. Her notebook flew from her hands, pages scattering. The pen rolled away.\n\nShe crawled after it, her fingers finding paper in the wet gravel. Not her notebook pages. Printed pages. Her manuscript pages. The ones she'd deleted two months ago, when she'd decided the plot was too dark, too real.\n\n*Chapter Six: Research or Alibi*, the header read.\n\n*Verse Two: The author falls. The detective runs. And the killer steps out from between the lines.*\n\nShe looked up. The rollercoaster was empty. Calhoun had disappeared into its wooden skeleton, chasing a shadow. And she was alone, holding proof that her trash file had become someone else's script.\n\nHer phone buzzed. A text from a blocked number.\n\n*Nice try. But you can't edit what's already printed.*\n\nShe looked at the scattered pages around her. At the knife in Calhoun's trunk. At the photo of herself, unaware.\n\nThe killer wasn't copying her book.\n\nHe was publishing it.\n\nAnd she was the only one who hadn't read the ending.\n\nThe rollercoaster's chain lift engaged with a metallic shriek, the cars beginning their slow, inevitable climb. Empty cars, riding toward the drop.\n\nDiana stood, her knees shaking, and did the only thing she could. She opened her notebook to a blank page and wrote: *The killer wanted an ending. The author wanted a rewrite. But some stories only end one way: with everyone on board.*\n\nShe underlined it three times, then ran toward the coaster, toward Calhoun, toward the place where fiction and flesh became the same screaming thing.\n\nThe first car reached the peak. The chain released. And the wooden bones of the ride began to sing."

      "title": "**The Blogger**",
      "content": "## Chapter 7: **The Blogger**\n\n*The problem with true crime is that someone has to live it before anyone else can read it.*\n\nThe rollercoaster screamed down its first drop with no one in the front car, and that was the worst sound Diana had ever heard\u2014a wooden throat howling out a warning with no lungs behind it. She ran toward the base of the structure, her notebook clutched to her chest like a shield, Calhoun's flashlight beam already swallowed by the coaster's lattice of timber and shadow.\n\n\"Calhoun!\" she shouted, but the wind took her voice and fed it to the chain lift, which had started again, grinding upward with its terrible patience.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Another blocked number text: *Check the third support beam. Bring the notebook.*\n\nShe stopped. The third support beam was where she'd killed off a minor character in Chapter Nine\u2014a blogger who'd gotten too close to the truth. In the manuscript, the killer had nailed the blogger's tablet to the wood, screen still glowing with a half-finished post. Diana had described the splinters around the nail heads in such specific detail that she'd actually dreamt about them.\n\n\"Don't,\" she whispered to herself, but her feet were already moving.\n\nThe fairground had gone quiet except for the coaster's machinery. No sirens yet\u2014Kline's backup was still navigating the coastal roads, still thinking this was a standard stakeout. They didn't know the story had its own timeline.\n\nThe third support beam was halfway up the maintenance stairs, a splintering zigzag of planks that hugged the coaster's spine. Diana climbed, one hand on the rickety rail, the other keeping her notebook dry inside her jacket. The rain had stopped, but the air was thick with salt and sawdust and something else\u2014ozone, like a storm that hadn't decided whether to break.\n\nShe found the tablet exactly where she'd written it.\n\nIt was newer than the one in her manuscript\u2014a sleek black slab, not the cracked iPad she'd imagined for her fictional blogger\u2014but the nail was perfect. A six-inch spike, driven through the center of the screen with surgical precision. The glass had splintered in a starburst pattern that matched her description word for word.\n\n*Verse Four: The author finds her words made solid. The killer finds his audience.*\n\nThe screen was still on. Battery at 2%, glowing red. A blog post was open, cursor blinking at the end of a paragraph:\n\n> *The problem with crime fiction is that authors think they're puppet masters. But what happens when the puppet cuts his own strings? Tonight, in a Maine town that doesn't exist on most maps, a writer is learning that research is just another word for evidence. And Detective Calhoun? He's learning that his partner was never really a suspect. She was always the next victim.*\n\nDiana's hands shook. The post was timestamped forty minutes ago. Before the body in the coaster car. Before the call. The killer had published the future.\n\nShe scrolled up. The blog was called *Between the Lines*. The banner photo was a stock image of a typewriter with blood-red keys. The author bio read: *Reading between the lines so you don't have to.*\n\nThe archive went back six weeks. Six weeks before the first body. Diana clicked the oldest post:\n\n> *New manuscript leak from Diana Marsh\u2014untitled, but the opening chapter's a killer. Literally. A boy on a rollercoaster, a book in his lap, a knife in his ribs. Art imitating life? Or the other way around?*\n\nThere were comments. Dozens of them. *Can't wait to read the rest. This is better than her published stuff. Someone should make this real.*\n\nSomeone had.\n\nHer phone rang. Not a text. A call. The blocked number.\n\nShe answered without thinking. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"A fan.\" The voice was different this time\u2014digitized, run through a filter that turned it into a chorus of whispers. \"You blocked me on Twitter. That was rude.\"\n\n\"I don't\u2014\" Diana's mind raced. She had a Twitter account she hadn't checked in months. Too many trolls, too many armchair detectives picking apart her forensic inaccuracies. \"I don't know who you are.\"\n\n\"Sure you do. I'm in your acknowledgments. Page 312 of your first hardcover. 'To the online community that keeps me honest.' That was me. I kept you honest. I kept all your drafts. Even the ones you thought you deleted.\"\n\nThe cloud. Her stomach turned over. She'd auto-synced her manuscript folder to a cloud drive, forgotten about it. Two months ago, when she'd decided the story was too dark, she'd dragged the whole folder to trash and emptied it. But cloud storage had versioning. Recovery windows. And apparently, an audience.\n\n\"You're the blogger,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm the blogger. I'm the killer. I'm your biggest fan and your harshest critic. Do you know how many plotholes I fixed before I ever touched a knife?\"\n\nCalhoun's voice echoed from somewhere above, muffled by wood and wind. \"Diana! Don't move!\"\n\nThe blogger heard it. \"He found the mannequin. Clever detective. But mannequins don't bleed, and neither does he. Not yet.\"\n\nDiana's grip tightened on the phone. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want you to finish it. The real ending. Not that sanitized crap you tried to sell to your agent. The one where the author dies and the story lives forever.\"\n\nBelow, the coaster cars completed their circuit and slowed into the station. Empty. Waiting.\n\n\"That's not the ending,\" Diana said.\n\n\"It is now. Write it. Write it in that notebook, and I'll let Calhoun live. Write anything else, and he takes the next ride.\"\n\nThe line went dead.\n\nDiana looked up. Calhoun was descending the stairs, his face grim, a piece of plastic in his hand. A mannequin's hand, severed at the wrist.\n\n\"He's not up there,\" Calhoun said. \"Just a dummy in a raincoat. And this.\" He held up a phone, cheap burner, taped to the dummy's chest. \"It was playing a recording. Footsteps, breathing. The whole thing was a\u2014\"\n\n\"Distraction.\" Diana showed him the tablet. The blog post. The comments.\n\nCalhoun read, his jaw tight. \"He's been publishing your drafts?\"\n\n\"For six weeks.\" Diana's voice sounded hollow. \"He's got an audience. They're cheering him on.\"\n\nThe burner phone in Calhoun's hand rang. They both stared at it. Calhoun answered, put it on speaker.\n\nThe filtered voice filled the space between them. \"Detective. Nice work with the dummy. But you're still holding the wrong evidence.\"\n\nCalhoun's eyes narrowed. \"What evidence?\"\n\n\"The knife in your trunk. The one you think Diana planted. Check the handle. There's a sticker. A little silver bird.\"\n\nTwitter. The logo. Diana's breath caught.\n\n\"That's not my knife,\" she said.\n\n\"I know,\" the blogger whispered. \"It's mine. I mailed it to you three weeks ago. Disguised as fan mail. You opened the package, you looked at it, you thought it was a prop. You put it in your trunk because you didn't know where else to put something that sharp and strange. You've been carrying my murder weapon for half a month, and you never even knew.\"\n\nCalhoun looked at Diana, and for the first time, she saw doubt in his eyes. Real doubt.\n\n\"That's insane,\" she said. \"I would remember\u2014\"\n\n\"Would you?\" The blogger's voice was almost gentle. \"You get so many packages. So many gifts from fans. You opened it on a Tuesday, while you were on the phone with your mother. You said, 'That's creepy,' but you didn't throw it away. You never throw anything away. You just file it under 'research.'\"\n\nHe was right. She had a box in her garage labeled exactly that. Knives sent by enthusiasts. Crime scene photos from weirdos. A lock of hair once, which she'd burned in the sink.\n\nCalhoun was already walking back to the car, his movements sharp with anger. Diana followed, the tablet tucked under her arm like stolen goods.\n\nThe trunk was still open from when he'd shown her the knife. Calhoun pulled out the evidence bag, turned it over. There, on the hilt, a tiny silver bird sticker, nearly worn away.\n\n\"Son of a bitch,\" Calhoun said softly.\n\nDiana's phone buzzed again. Not a call. A notification. Someone had mentioned her on Twitter.\n\nShe opened the app, hands shaking. The tweet was from @BetweenTheLinesBlog: *Nice of @DianaMarshBooks to finally join us. Now we can all read the ending together.*\n\nAttached was a photo. A live photo, the corner said. Diana clicked it.\n\nIt showed her, right now, standing at the open trunk with Calhoun. Taken from the top of the rollercoaster, from the dummy's perspective.\n\nThe caption read: *Verse Five: The author realizes she's been in the story the whole time.*\n\nCalhoun saw it too. He spun, his gun coming up, scanning the dark fairground. \"Where is he?\"\n\nDiana looked at the tablet. The screen had gone black, battery finally dead. But she'd seen enough. The blog had a subscriber count in the thousands. A Discord link. A Patreon.\n\nHe wasn't just killing people.\n\nHe was monetizing it.\n\nHer notebook felt heavy in her jacket. The blogger wanted an ending. But endings were her business.\n\nShe opened it to the last page she'd written: *The killer wanted an ending. The author wanted a rewrite. But some stories only end one way: with everyone on board.*\n\nShe crossed it out. Hard. Three black lines that tore the paper.\n\nThen she wrote, her pen digging into the page: *The blogger forgot that writers read. And the best way to kill a story is to stop turning the pages.*\n\nShe took a photo of the new line. Posted it to Twitter. Tagged @BetweenTheLinesBlog.\n\nThe reply was instant: *You think you can stop? You're trending.*\n\nCalhoun grabbed her wrist. \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Giving him what he wants.\" Diana's voice was steady now, the steadiness of a character who'd finally found her motivation. \"Me. Live. Unedited.\"\n\nShe typed another tweet: *You want the real ending? Meet me where the first draft died. One hour. No cops. Or I delete the whole manuscript.*\n\nShe hit send before Calhoun could stop her.\n\nThe blogger's reply came as a direct message: *The rollercoaster. Midnight. Bring the notebook. Leave the detective.*\n\nDiana looked at Calhoun. \"He's going to kill you if you come.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I better not get caught.\"\n\nThe rollercoaster's chain lift engaged again. Empty cars, climbing toward a drop that would lead nowhere.\n\nDiana closed her notebook. The story wasn't writing itself anymore.\n\nShe was writing it in real time, and the killer was just another character who'd forgotten who held the pen.\n\nThe only question was whether she could finish before he turned the page."

      "content": "## Chapter 8: **Lighthouse Red**\n\n*The difference between a lighthouse and a warning is who built it.*\n\nThe lighthouse wasn\u2019t on any map Diana had seen. It rose from the rocks three miles past the fairground, a skeletal iron tower painted in flaking red lead paint, its lamp dark. The kind of place that existed only in maritime archives and property tax disputes. The kind of place a man might take a woman if he wanted to write an ending no one would find until the tide went out.\n\nCalhoun killed the engine. The mist had thickened into fog, and the rollercoaster\u2019s skeleton was a ghost in the rearview, its peaks lost to the weather. \u201cYou sure this is the spot?\u201d\n\nDiana held up her phone. The blogger\u2019s last DM glowed on the screen: *The lighthouse at the end of the point. Red as the ink you\u2019re bleeding. Come alone or I hit publish on Verse Four.*\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s watching,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll know if you come up with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll know I\u2019m here anyway.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s hand rested on his sidearm. \u201cThat trunk\u2019s not exactly soundproof.\u201d\n\nHe meant the knife. The one they\u2019d found in his trunk after the interrogation, wrapped in one of Diana\u2019s own promotional bookmarks. *Diana Marsh\u2014Where the Story Cuts Deep.* The killer\u2019s sense of humor ran to the literal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to stay behind,\u201d Diana said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you he wants a solo act. You come, he ghosts. And we lose our only chance to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what? Become the final chapter?\u201d Calhoun\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re not a detective. You\u2019re a loose end he\u2019s tying into a bow.\u201d\n\nShe opened her notebook to the page she\u2019d written in the car. *The blogger waited in the lantern room, but he wasn\u2019t alone. He\u2019d brought the whole audience with him, livestreaming from the dark.*\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll cut the cord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to help? Find his server. Find where he\u2019s uploading from. This\u2014\u201d she tapped the notebook, \u201c\u2014is just the cover copy.\u201d\n\nCalhoun studied her for a long moment. The fog pressed against the windows, turning the car into a confession booth. Finally, he reached into the back seat and pulled out a black Kevlar vest. \u201cPut this on. And this.\u201d A burner phone, cheap plastic. \u201cSpeed-dial one is me. Don\u2019t write a speech. Just scream.\u201d\n\nShe took the vest. It smelled of old sweat and gun oil, like every bad decision that had ever worn it. \u201cWhat if he searches me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re already dead.\u201d Not cruel. Just police work.\n\nThe lighthouse loomed closer as she walked. The path was shale and broken shells, the fog so dense she could feel it coiling around her throat. Her phone buzzed\u2014another DM. *Don\u2019t look back. The detective\u2019s not the one with a knife to his career.*\n\nShe didn\u2019t look. She kept her eyes on the red tower, counting her steps, counting her breaths. The door at the base was rusted iron, ajar. She pushed it open and the smell hit her: ozone and old wax and something sweet, like rotting paper.\n\nInside, a spiral staircase climbed into darkness. No lights. No sound except the ocean chewing the rocks below and, very faintly, the click of a keyboard.\n\nShe climbed. The steps were worn concave by a century of keepers\u2019 boots. Her own footsteps sounded wrong\u2014too light, too alive. At the landing, she paused. A faint red glow seeped from under the door to the lantern room. Not the lamp. LED strips, the kind gamers used to backlight their monitors.\n\nShe pushed the door open.\n\nThe lantern room was a cage of glass and brass, the great lens dismantled and shoved aside. In its place, a folding table held three monitors, a streaming deck, and a laptop open to a Discord channel scrolling faster than she could read. The username at the top: **BetweenTheLinesBlog**. Status: **LIVE**.\n\nA figure sat with his back to her, silhouetted against the fogged windows. He wore a hoodie, the drawstrings pulled tight. His hands moved across a mechanical keyboard, each keystroke a tiny gunshot.\n\n\u201cClose the door,\u201d he said. Voice modulated, run through some filter that stripped it of age or accent. Just ones and zeros shaped like a man. \u201cYou\u2019re letting the narrative escape.\u201d\n\nDiana stepped inside. The door clicked shut behind her. \u201cYou wanted me. Here I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWanted?\u201d The figure laughed, a sound like corrupted audio. \u201cI needed you. There\u2019s a difference. Wanted is for fans. Needed is for structure.\u201d He spun his chair around.\n\nThe face beneath the hood was a mask. Not metaphorically. A hard plastic Halloween mask of a raven, beak sharp and black. Behind it, eyes glinted in the monitor light.\n\n\u201cYou can call me Poe,\u201d he said. \u201cFor branding purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCute.\u201d Diana kept her hands visible, notebook tucked under her arm. \u201cYou want to tell me why you\u2019re publishing my trash files?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrash?\u201d Poe leaned forward. On the monitors, she saw herself\u2014three angles, live. One from a camera in the corner. One from a body cam she didn\u2019t know she was wearing. One from a drone hovering outside the window. \u201cDiana, those were the only honest pages you ever wrote. Before your editor got to them. Before the market research. Verse One: The author discovers the body. Verse Two: The detective suspects the author. Verse Three\u2014\u201d he gestured at the screens, \u201c\u2014the author becomes the protagonist. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nShe opened her notebook. \u201cThis is where you monologue, right? Explain your origin story. How I wronged you. How my words *made* you do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a character.\u201d He stood, and she saw the knife in his hand. Not the one from Calhoun\u2019s trunk. This one was older, a curator\u2019s blade, the kind used to cut parchment. \u201cI\u2019m the algorithm. I\u2019m the part of you that knows every story ends in blood but you hit \u2018save\u2019 anyway. I just\u2026 optimized the process.\u201d\n\nHe clicked something on the laptop. The Discord chat exploded. **$50 donated: Show us the notebook!** **$100: Cut her!** **$250: Read the last page!**\n\nPatreon tiers scrolled on a third monitor. For $5 a month, subscribers got early access to the \u201cdrafts.\u201d For $50, they could vote on the next victim\u2019s method. For $500, they could suggest dialogue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing people for Twitch bits,\u201d Diana said. It came out flatter than she intended. Horror had a way of numbing the obvious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m killing people because you wrote it beautifully.\u201d He opened a drawer and pulled out a sheaf of papers. Her manuscript. The one she\u2019d burned on her back patio six months ago, watching the smoke curl into the neighbor\u2019s birch trees. \u201cChapter Five. The lighthouse. The red lens. The author realizes she\u2019s been in the story the whole time. Remember?\u201d\n\nShe remembered. She\u2019d written it during the divorce, when the bourbon was cheap and the dreams were worse. A woman trapped in a tower, realizing the keeper had been dead for years and the light she\u2019d been tending was just a reflection of her own pulse.\n\n\u201cI deleted that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou shredded it. I recovered it.\u201d He held up a thumb drive. \u201cForensic software is a wonderful thing. You\u2019d be amazed what people leave in their recycle bins. Or their search history. Or their photo stream.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out the photo. The one Calhoun had shown her in the interrogation room. Diana, unaware, drinking coffee in her own kitchen. The timestamp was from three weeks ago. Before any of this.\n\n\u201cI was your beta reader,\u201d Poe said. \u201cYour biggest fan. I even commented on your blog. \u2018Love the new direction, but the body count feels low.\u2019 You replied: \u2018Wait for the final draft.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fog outside thickened. The drone\u2019s camera feed showed nothing but gray static. Inside, the chat demanded blood.\n\nDiana\u2019s fingers found the pen in her pocket. The one Calhoun had given her. \u201cSo this is revenge? I didn\u2019t write fast enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is collaboration.\u201d He slid the knife across the table. It spun like a compass needle, pointing at her. \u201cPick it up. Write the ending on the glass. In blood or ink, I don\u2019t care. But make it good. The Patreon subscribers are waiting.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the monitors. Subscriber count: 4,287. Live viewers: 1,103. Donations this stream: $8,940.\n\nThe burner phone in her pocket felt hot. Speed-dial one. She didn\u2019t press it. Instead, she opened her notebook to the last page. The line she\u2019d written in the car. *The blogger waited in the lantern room, but he wasn\u2019t alone. He\u2019d brought the whole audience with him, livestreaming from the dark.*\n\nShe tore it out. Crumpled it. Tossed it at his feet.\n\n\u201cNew draft,\u201d she said. \u201cThe author burns the tower down.\u201d\n\nPoe tilted his head. The raven mask\u2019s beak caught the light. \u201cYou think you can\u2014\u201d\n\nThe window behind him exploded.\n\nNot glass. The lens. The ancient, dusty Fresnel lens that had been shoved aside. It shattered inward, a thousand prisms of red and white, and through it came Calhoun, shoulder-first, gun out, screaming something about warrants and probable cause that got lost in the static.\n\nPoe moved like a man who\u2019d practiced this. He grabbed the laptop, the thumb drive, and dove for the stairs. Diana moved faster. She kicked the knife off the table, sent it skittering into the corner, then threw her body against the door. It slammed shut. She held it.\n\n\u201cPolice!\u201d Calhoun\u2019s voice was raw. \u201cDrop the\u2014\u201d\n\nBut Poe was already at the window, the drone hovering close enough to grab. He snagged it, yanked it inside, and threw it at Calhoun\u2019s face. The detective flinched. That was enough.\n\nPoe went through the glass.\n\nNot the broken lens. The other window. He dove headfirst into the fog, hoodie flaring like wings. Diana heard the impact\u2014not a body on rocks, but a splash. The water below was deep enough. He\u2019d done his research.\n\nCalhoun was at the window, gun aimed into nothing. \u201cShit. Shit.\u201d He lowered the weapon. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\nDiana nodded, but she wasn\u2019t. Her hands were shaking. The monitors still showed the livestream, but the chat had devolved into chaos. **HE JUMPED!** **IS THIS PART OF IT?** **REFUND!**\n\nThen a new message appeared, pinned by the moderator\u2014Poe\u2019s account.\n\n**@BetweenTheLinesBlog: Verse Four posts at midnight. Bring a life vest.**\n\nThe laptop screen went black. The stream ended.\n\nCalhoun turned, his face pale in the red glow of the LED strips. \u201cWe need to move. He\u2019ll have a boat. We can\u2014\u201d\n\nDiana wasn\u2019t listening. She was looking at the table. At the one thing Poe had left behind. Not the knife. Not the thumb drive.\n\nA single manuscript page. Chapter Five, original draft. The one she\u2019d burned.\n\nAt the bottom, in her own handwriting, a note she didn\u2019t remember writing: *The keeper\u2019s name is Elias Marsh. He dies at the end, but the light stays on. Because that\u2019s what we do. We keep the light on, even when we\u2019re dead.*\n\nElias Marsh. Her father\u2019s name. A man who\u2019d walked into the Atlantic when she was twelve and never walked out.\n\nThe foghorn sounded. Not the lighthouse\u2014this one was dark, dead. It came from the rollercoaster, a recording maybe, or just the wind playing tricks on wood.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s burner phone buzzed in her pocket. She answered.\n\n\u201cDid you get him?\u201d Kline\u2019s voice, sharp and staticky.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Diana said. \u201cBut I got his outline.\u201d\n\nShe folded the page, tucked it into her notebook next to the vest that smelled of other people\u2019s courage. Outside, the fog had turned to rain again, hard and purposeful.\n\nThe rollercoaster\u2019s chain lift shrieked. Empty cars, climbing.\n\nMidnight was ten minutes away.\n\nVerse Four was already written. She just had to find the page where she\u2019d killed her father, and change the ending before the killer posted it for 4,287 subscribers who\u2019d paid to see her bleed.\n\nThe lighthouse door banged open behind her. Not Calhoun. He was still upstairs, calling for backup.\n\nIt was the wind. Just the wind.\n\nBut the wind didn\u2019t smell of bourbon and saltwater and the particular cologne her father had worn the day he left.\n\nShe ran."

      "content": "## Chapter 9: **Consultant**\n\n*\u201cThe difference between a consultant and a witness is that one gets paid to guess, and the other pays for guessing wrong.\u201d*\n\nThe rain turned to sleet somewhere between the lighthouse and the highway. Diana watched it collect in the wipers\u2019 arc, a slurry of ice and salt that refused to clear. In the passenger seat, her notebook was open to the page Vance had given them\u2014a photocopy of her father\u2019s handwriting, dated three days before he walked into the water.\n\n*The boy watches the wood. He sees the cracks before they break. I told him the light is what matters, not the keeper. He asked what happens when the keeper is the crack.*\n\nCalhoun drove with one hand on the wheel, the other on his phone, which hadn\u2019t stopped buzzing since they\u2019d left Vance\u2019s cottage. Kline, demanding updates. SWAT, wanting coordinates. The media, somehow, asking for statements. The detective\u2019s jaw was a hard line in the dashboard glow.\n\n\u201cYou should have told me about the journal,\u201d he said. Not angry. Tired.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was one.\u201d Diana\u2019s fingers traced the copied words. The paper trembled slightly\u2014she told herself it was the car\u2019s vibration. \u201cMy mother said he left nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother moved to Florida six months after he died and never looked back.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s tone was flat, factual. \u201cVance said she wouldn\u2019t let them search the house.\u201d\n\nDiana had known that. She\u2019d been thirteen, holding her mother\u2019s hand while the police asked questions. *He was depressed. He drank. He talked about the waves.* All true. None of it the whole truth. \u201cShe was protecting him. Or us. Or the version of him that paid the mortgage.\u201d\n\nThe phone buzzed again. Calhoun glanced at it, then at her. \u201cVance is coming. Against my advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a retired cop with a bad hip and a worse drinking problem. He\u2019ll get in the way.\u201d\n\nDiana folded the photocopy into her notebook. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who knew both of them. Elias and Poe.\u201d\n\nThe name sat between them like a third passenger. Evan Poe, age nineteen in the photograph Vance had shown them\u2014grease-smeared coveralls, a wrench over one shoulder, standing beside the rollercoaster\u2019s lift motor. The same face Diana had seen in the shadows of the coaster\u2019s skeleton, but younger. Softer. The kind of face that could watch a man drown and think it was a story worth keeping.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s knuckles whitened on the wheel. \u201cPoe was a maintenance grunt at the fairground the summer your father died. Vance interviewed him. He said Elias had been teaching him about the lighthouse, about responsibility.\u201d The detective\u2019s voice carried the weight of old case notes. \u201cPoe told Vance that your father was a poet with a drinking problem who talked to the gulls.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father quoted Dylan Thomas to the seagulls,\u201d Diana said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make him a poet. It makes him a clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes him a character. And characters are easier to kill than people.\u201d\n\nThey pulled into the cracked asphalt lot of a twenty-four-hour diner called The Gull\u2019s Perch. The sign flickered *OPEN* in neon blue, reflecting off the sleet. Inside, the air was thick with fryer grease and cigarette smoke that had soaked into the vinyl booths since the smoking ban. Vance was already there, a silhouette in the back booth, a glass of something amber catching the light.\n\nHe looked older than he had twenty minutes ago. Retirement did that to cops\u2014aged them in dog years. But his eyes were clear when he looked up, tracking Calhoun\u2019s badge on his belt before settling on Diana.\n\n\u201cYou look like him,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAround the eyes. Like you\u2019re waiting for the punchline.\u201d\n\nDiana slid into the booth. Calhoun remained standing, scanning the empty diner. \u201cYou said you had the rest of the journal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I had *pages*.\u201d Vance sipped his whiskey. \u201cYour father gave them to me the day he died. Sealed envelope, my name on it. Asked me to hold it until \u2018the boy\u2019 came looking.\u201d He pulled a manila folder from his jacket, edges frayed. \u201cTook fifteen years. I was starting to think he meant you.\u201d\n\nThe folder contained three sheets, handwritten on both sides. Diana recognized the paper\u2014coastal water commission letterhead, the same kind that had been in her mother\u2019s desk for years. Her father\u2019s script was cramped, urgent.\n\n*Poe thinks the coaster is a metaphor. He thinks the cracks in the wood are prophecies. I told him wood is just wood, that metal fatigues, that physics doesn\u2019t care about poetry. But he\u2019s seen the reports. The accidents. The way the chain lift shrieks before it catches. He says the ride is alive, and alive things need blood to remember.*\n\nCalhoun leaned over her shoulder, his breath warm against the cold she\u2019d brought in. \u201cWhat accidents?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree in the year before Elias died,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAll maintenance-related. All hushed up by the fairground owners. Kids getting hurt on the coaster\u2014minor stuff, broken arms, concussions. But Poe was on the crew. He would\u2019ve seen the inspection reports.\u201d\n\nDiana turned the page. *He asked what I\u2019d give to keep the light on. I said everything. He smiled. That\u2019s when I knew he wasn\u2019t asking about the lighthouse.*\n\nHer fingers went numb. \u201cHe was grooming him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr the other way around.\u201d Vance refilled his glass from a flask. \u201cYour father was drowning, Miss Marsh. In debt, in drink, in the weight of keeping that light burning for ships that never thanked him. Poe offered him a way out. A story where the keeper\u2019s death means something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuicide by proxy,\u201d Calhoun said. He\u2019d gone still, the way he did when pieces clicked into place. \u201cPoe convinces Elias to walk into the water, makes it look like a drowning. In exchange, Elias leaves him the journal. The blueprint for a perfect crime.\u201d\n\nVance slid a photograph across the table. It showed the rollercoaster\u2019s understructure, a maze of wooden beams and cross-braces. In the center, barely visible, a figure crouched with a chisel. \u201cPoe carved his initials into the support beams. We found them after the fourth accident. By then he\u2019d already quit. Moved away.\u201d\n\nDiana studied the photo. The initials were small, precise: *E.P.* But beside them, fainter, were other letters: *E.M.* Her father\u2019s initials. The chisel marks overlapped, a palimpsest of two men leaving their scars on the same wood.\n\nHer phone buzzed. A Twitter notification: @BetweenTheLinesBlog has posted.\n\nShe opened it. A photo of the diner\u2019s parking lot, taken from across the street. The timestamp was sixty seconds ago. The caption: *Chapter 9: The consultant drinks whiskey. The detective stands guard. The author finally reads the footnotes.*\n\nCalhoun saw it, was already moving toward the door, hand on his weapon. Vance didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been following you since the lighthouse,\u201d the old detective said. \u201cProbably before. He likes to watch the moment when people realize they\u2019re not the author\u2014they\u2019re the footnote.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s hands shook as she typed a reply: *You missed the part where the footnote kills the narrator.*\n\nThe response was immediate, a DM this time: *I never miss. I just wait for the right page. Bring Vance\u2019s key. The one that controls the lights. I know he gave it to you.*\n\nShe looked up. Vance was watching her, not the phone. \u201cHe knows about the key.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he does.\u201d Vance pulled a brass skeleton key from his pocket, slid it across the table. It was heavy, notched in a pattern that looked more like teeth than machinery. \u201cYour father designed the backup system. One key, one switch. Turns off every light on the fairground. He said it was for emergencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr for making sure no one sees you leave,\u201d Calhoun said from the doorway. He\u2019d holstered his gun, but his shoulders were still tense. \u201cCar\u2019s clear. But he\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nDiana took the key. It was warm from Vance\u2019s hand. \u201cYou want me to give this to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to use it,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhen the time comes. Turn off the lights, and the coaster stops. Chain lift needs power. No power, no ride. No ride, no ending.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you write your own.\u201d Vance finished his whiskey. \u201cYour father thought he could save the boy by giving him a story. He was wrong. You don\u2019t save people with stories. You save them by letting them be a single sentence in your book, not the whole damn plot.\u201d\n\nCalhoun\u2019s phone rang. He answered, listened, then cursed softly. \u201cKline found Poe\u2019s Patreon. He\u2019s got a tier called \u2018Executive Producer.\u2019 Two hundred subscribers at a hundred bucks a month. They vote on the methods.\u201d\n\nThe sleet had turned to snow, fat flakes that stuck to the diner\u2019s windows. Diana watched them blur the neon sign outside, turning *OPEN* into a smear of blue light. Her notebook sat on the table, open to the last line she\u2019d written: *The best way to kill a story is to stop turning the pages.*\n\nShe crossed it out. Wrote beneath it: *The best way to kill a story is to be the one who writes the last page.*\n\nVance saw it, nodded. \u201cYour father never understood that. He thought the light was the point. But darkness has its own vocabulary. Poe learned it. Now you have to.\u201d\n\nCalhoun was back at the table, his phone dark. \u201cSWAT\u2019s twenty minutes out. Kline wants us to wait.\u201d\n\nDiana stood, pocketing the key. \u201cPoe wants me there at midnight. That\u2019s seven minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll try.\u201d She pulled on her jacket, felt the weight of the notebook, the key, the vest that smelled of other people\u2019s survival. \u201cBut he needs me to write the ending first. Otherwise it\u2019s just a snuff film, and he\u2019s just another murderer with a Wi-Fi connection.\u201d\n\nVance caught her wrist as she turned. His grip was strong for an old man. \u201cYour father\u2019s last entry. The one I didn\u2019t show you.\u201d He pressed a folded paper into her palm. \u201cRead it when you\u2019re on the coaster. Not before.\u201d\n\nCalhoun followed her out into the snow. The car was where they\u2019d left it, but the driver\u2019s side window was fogged from the inside. Someone had been sitting there. On the windshield, written in the thin layer of snow: *Verse Four starts now.*\n\nDiana wiped it away with her sleeve. The car started on the first turn of the key. Behind them, Vance stood in the diner\u2019s doorway, a silhouette against the blue"

      "title": "**Mia**",
      "content": "## Chapter 10: **Mia**\n\n*The difference between a twist and a lie is that a twist remembers where it came from.*\n\nThe snow came down like ash from a burning manuscript, each flake a word Diana had written and regretted. In the passenger seat of Calhoun\u2019s unmarked sedan, she unfolded Vance\u2019s note with hands that had finally stopped shaking. The paper was thin, onionskin, the kind her father had used for his lighthouse logs.\n\n*Mia,* it read. *The keeper\u2019s log wasn\u2019t about the light. It was about the girl who turned it off.*\n\nBeneath that, a date: August 14, 1998. The night Elias Marsh walked into the Atlantic.\n\nDiana\u2019s breath fogged the window. Outside, the rollercoaster\u2019s skeletal frame rose against the sky, its wooden spine curved like a question mark. The chain lift was silent now, the cars frozen halfway up the first drop, frosted with snow. A single worklight illuminated the ticket booth, where someone had spray-painted **@BetweenTheLinesBlog** in red.\n\nCalhoun cut the engine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, folding the note back into her notebook, next to the life vest that smelled of other people\u2019s survival. \u201cI do. Mia was what he called me when I was little. Before I learned to spell Diana.\u201d\n\nThe name felt foreign on her tongue, like a character she\u2019d written and abandoned. She\u2019d been six when she\u2019d demanded to be called Diana, after the Roman goddess of the hunt. Her father had laughed, called her his little moon-cursed huntress, but he\u2019d stopped calling her Mia. It had been their secret word, the name he\u2019d whisper when she was sick or scared.\n\nNow it was a breadcrumb in a murder story.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s hand found hers on the seat. His palm was calloused, warm. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting in the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe note said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe note said leave the detective. It didn\u2019t say the detective would listen.\u201d He checked his Glock, the motion practiced, quiet. \u201cKline\u2019s SWAT team is staging at the fairground entrance. They\u2019ll move when I give the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it.\u201d Diana zipped her jacket, felt the weight of the key Vance had pressed into her palm. It was old, brass, notched for a lock that probably didn\u2019t exist anymore. \u201cHe\u2019ll see them. He\u2019ll run. And he\u2019ll keep posting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe needs me alive to write the ending.\u201d She opened the door, letting in the cold and the smell of creosote and salt. \u201cThat\u2019s the only leverage I have.\u201d\n\nThe rollercoaster groaned in the wind. Wood and steel, built in 1927, according to the faded plaque by the entrance. The *Thunderbolt*, they\u2019d called it, though locals just called it the Splinter. It had killed three people in its lifetime: a maintenance worker in \u201963, a teenager in \u201981, a grandmother in 2015 who\u2019d stood up during the final turn. Diana had written about it once, in a novel called *The Fall*. The killer had used the coaster\u2019s chain lift to garrote a private investigator.\n\nShe wondered if Poe had read it. If he\u2019d voted on the method.\n\nHer boots crunched on frozen gravel. The ticket booth\u2019s window was smashed, glass glittering like punctuation marks. Inside, a tablet was mounted on the wall, its screen cycling through subscriber counts: **4,287 paying members. 3,892 currently viewing.** A Discord chat scrolled beneath, usernames she recognized from her own Twitter mentions: @PlotTwistPatty, @NoirNerd88, @MysteryMaven.\n\nThey were here. Watching.\n\nThe tablet\u2019s camera light blinked on.\n\n\u201cMia Marsh.\u201d The voice came from the coaster\u2019s loading platform, distorted through a cheap speaker. Not Poe\u2019s voice\u2014not the soft, almost gentle tone from the phone calls. This was digital, autotuned to anonymity. \u201cYou brought the notebook.\u201d\n\nDiana held it up, the leather cover dark with snow. \u201cI brought the rewrite.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it at the base of the lift.\u201d\n\nShe set it down, pen clipped to the front pocket. The wind flipped the pages, showing glimpses of crossed-out lines, marginalia in her own hand. *The killer wanted an ending. The author wanted a rewrite.* All those false starts.\n\nCalhoun had melted into the shadows by the funnel cake stand, his silhouette barely visible. Good. She hoped his finger was off the trigger. Hoped he understood that SWAT would be too loud, too final. This needed to end with words, not bullets.\n\nShe climbed the wooden stairs to the loading platform. Each step creaked a different note, a chord of decay. At the top, a figure sat in the lead car, back to her, hood up. Small. Almost child-sized.\n\nNot Poe. Too small.\n\n\u201cHello, Mia.\u201d The voice was real now, coming from the figure. Female. Young. \u201cI read your first draft. The one where the lighthouse keeper\u2019s daughter turns off the light so her father\u2019s boat will crash. You burned it, but I found the ashes.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s hand found the cold metal railing. The story was true\u2014she\u2019d written it at seventeen, in a spiral notebook she\u2019d thrown into the fireplace after her mother found it. The keeper\u2019s daughter, complicit in her father\u2019s death. A fantasy of control, of punishment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe girl in the story was named Mia.\u201d The figure turned, and Diana saw her face. Maybe twenty-two. Dark hair, cut short. Eyes that were older than the wood beneath their feet. \u201cYou named her after yourself. The parts you wanted to kill.\u201d\n\nThe Discord chat on the tablet exploded. **IT\u2019S HER!** **THE GIRL FROM VERSE TWO!**\n\nVerse Two. The second murder. A college student in Portland, found in a shipping container with pages of a manuscript stuffed in her throat. Diana had studied the crime scene photos, written three chapters based on the staging. The victim\u2019s name had been Sarah Chen.\n\nBut the girl in the car wasn\u2019t Sarah Chen.\n\n\u201cMy name is Mia,\u201d she said. \u201cMia Vance.\u201d\n\nThe key in Diana\u2019s pocket went cold. Vance. The old man in the diner. The keeper of her father\u2019s secrets.\n\n\u201cYour father didn\u2019t walk into the ocean, Mia.\u201d The girl\u2014Mia\u2014patted the seat beside her. \u201cHe rowed out to it. In a boat named *Diana*. He was looking for me. I was the one who turned off the light.\u201d\n\nThe wind stopped. The snow hung suspended.\n\nDiana\u2019s notebook, at the base of the lift, flipped open to the page she\u2019d written in the diner: *The best way to kill a story is to be the one who writes the last page.*\n\nA new line appeared beneath it, written in the same pen, the same hand\u2014her hand, but not her memory: *But some stories have two authors, and only one pen.*\n\nMia Vance smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing with you for three years. Every Patreon vote, every Discord thread. I\u2019m your most dedicated subscriber.\u201d She held up a thumb drive. \u201cVerse Four. It\u2019s already uploaded. Scheduled to post at 12:01. Unless you give me the ending I want.\u201d\n\nDiana\u2019s phone buzzed. A DM from @BetweenTheLinesBlog: *She\u2019s not the killer, Mia. She\u2019s the plot device. And plot devices don\u2019t get final chapters. You do.*\n\nThe figure in the car wasn\u2019t Poe. She was the audience.\n\nAnd Poe was somewhere else, watching the stream, waiting for Diana to realize she\u2019d been writing a collaboration.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s voice crackled in her earpiece\u2014when had she put in an earpiece? \u201cDiana, we have a problem. Vance isn\u2019t in the diner. He never was. The security footage is looped.\u201d\n\nThe old man had been a ghost story. A prologue.\n\nMia Vance stood, stepping out of the car with the careful grace of someone who\u2019d studied Diana\u2019s prose for movement cues. \u201cYour father\u2019s boat sank because I turned off the lighthouse light. Your father died because I let him. And you\u2019ve spent twenty-five years writing around the truth because you can\u2019t face the fact that you wanted him to die too.\u201d\n\nShe pressed the thumb drive into Diana\u2019s palm. It was warm, alive.\n\n\u201cVerse Four is a livestream. Calhoun\u2019s house. His daughter\u2019s home from college. The subscribers voted. They want to see how a detective screams when it\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\nThe earpiece exploded with static. Calhoun was already running, snow kicking up behind him, but Diana knew the math. Twenty minutes to the fairground entrance. Fifteen to his car. Ten to his house.\n\nMidnight was thirty seconds away.\n\nThe rollercoaster\u2019s chain lift shuddered to life. The empty cars began their climb, groaning under the weight of ghosts.\n\nMia leaned close, her breath mint and cordite. \u201cYou can stop the upload. The key Vance gave you fits the lock on the breaker box. It kills the whole grid. No stream, no proof, no crime.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut it also kills the story. And you\u2019re not a killer, Diana. You\u2019re a writer. You need the ending more than they need to live.\u201d\n\nThe tablet\u2019s counter hit zero.\n\n**4,287 subscribers. 4,287 currently viewing.**\n\nVerse Four had begun.\n\nDiana looked at the key. At the thumb drive. At Mia Vance\u2019s face, which was her own face at seventeen, the age she\u2019d been when she\u2019d burned the first draft.\n\nThe girl turned off the light. The father died. The daughter wrote.\n\nBut which daughter?\n\nThe rollercoaster reached the apex. The chain disengaged with a metallic *clack* that echoed across the fairground.\n\nMia stepped back into the car. \u201cYou have until the drop. After that, the story writes itself.\u201d\n\nThe cars began to roll forward, gravity taking hold, and Diana understood the architecture of the trap. The coaster only had one ending. The track didn\u2019t branch. It just fell.\n\nShe ran. Not toward the breaker box. Not toward Calhoun\u2019s screaming voice in her ear.\n\nToward the notebook. Toward the pen.\n\nToward the last empty page, where she wrote, her hand moving faster than the cars on the track: *The girl in the coaster wasn\u2019t the villain. She was the epilogue. And epilogues don\u2019t need permission to exist. They just need the truth.*\n\nShe photographed the page. Posted it.\n\nTagged @BetweenTheLinesBlog.\n\nThe reply was instant, from an account she\u2019d never seen: **@EliasMarshKeeper: The light\u2019s back on, Mia. Come home.**\n\nThe rollercoaster plunged.\n\nThe screen went dark.\n\nThe story, for the first time in twenty-five years, waited for her to turn the page."
